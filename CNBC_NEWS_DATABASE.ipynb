Amazon said the facility could power the equivalent of 46,000 U.K. homes and would be the U.K.'s \\\"largest corporate wind power purchase agreement.\\\" Additionally, two solar projects in North Carolina and Virginia will amount to 215 MW of total capacity, with Amazon expecting them to produce 500,997 MWh per year. The projects announced Thursday are expected to start generating energy in 2021. They are not owned by the company, but it says its commitment to purchase their output enables the projects to be built. In a statement issued Thursday, Amazon's Director of Sustainability Kara Hurst said the firm was \\\"committed to minimizing our carbon emissions and reaching 80% renewable energy use across the company by 2024.\\\"In June, Amazon was one of more than 700 firms targeted by 88 investors \\\"for not reporting environmental information.\\\" The aim of the investors was to push businesses such as Amazon to disclose information via the CDP, a not-for-profit platform which enables companies to divulge environmental performance data.A few months earlier, in April, thousands of Amazon employees signed an open letter to CEO Jeff Bezos and the firm's board of directors, imploring them to take action on climate change.In September, Amazon co-founded an initiative called The Climate Pledge, which asks signatories to become \\\"net zero carbon across their businesses\\\" by the year 2040.It has also launched what it calls a \\\"transparency website\\\" which it uses to report on what it describes as its \\\"sustainability commitments, initiatives, and performance.\\\" The site also has information on the firm's carbon footprint, which it reports as being 44.40 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for the 2018 fiscal year.Amazon is just one of many global technology firms looking to power operations using renewable sources of energy. In March 2019, for example, Microsoft signed a 15-year power purchase agreement for the energy produced by a 74-megawatt solar power facility in North Carolina, while in April 2018 Apple announced its global facilities were powered using \\\"100 percent clean energy.\\\"Making sure that its facilities are powered by clean energy is a multi-faceted process for Apple.In its Environmental Responsibility Report covering the 2018 fiscal year the California-headquartered firm said that, where feasible, it sourced renewable energy by building its own projects. In addition, it invests capital to become a part owner in wind and solar projects and signs \\\"long-term renewable energy contracts.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 581,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"cnbc, Articles, Politics, source:tagname:The New York Times\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"header_image\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 479,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103807719-GettyImages-578137340.jpg?v=1529472215\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"raw_description\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 594,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"<div class=\\\"group\\\"><p>China's retail sales growth surged in August to its quickest pace in more than three years, beating forecasts, but analysts said the jump largely reflected stronger inflation, not necessarily quicker underlying growth. </p><p>Retail sales, which are tracked in nominal terms, grew 17.1% from a year earlier, compared with 16.4% in July.

Amazon said the facility could power the equivalent of 46,000 U.K. homes and would be the U.K.'s \\\"largest corporate wind power purchase agreement.\\\" Additionally, two solar projects in North Carolina and Virginia will amount to 215 MW of total capacity, with Amazon expecting them to produce 500,997 MWh per year. The projects announced Thursday are expected to start generating energy in 2021. They are not owned by the company, but it says its commitment to purchase their output enables the projects to be built. In a statement issued Thursday, Amazon's Director of Sustainability Kara Hurst said the firm was \\\"committed to minimizing our carbon emissions and reaching 80% renewable energy use across the company by 2024.\\\"In June, Amazon was one of more than 700 firms targeted by 88 investors \\\"for not reporting environmental information.\\\" The aim of the investors was to push businesses such as Amazon to disclose information via the CDP, a not-for-profit platform which enables companies to divulge environmental performance data.A few months earlier, in April, thousands of Amazon employees signed an open letter to CEO Jeff Bezos and the firm's board of directors, imploring them to take action on climate change.In September, Amazon co-founded an initiative called The Climate Pledge, which asks signatories to become \\\"net zero carbon across their businesses\\\" by the year 2040.It has also launched what it calls a \\\"transparency website\\\" which it uses to report on what it describes as its \\\"sustainability commitments, initiatives, and performance.\\\" The site also has information on the firm's carbon footprint, which it reports as being 44.40 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for the 2018 fiscal year.Amazon is just one of many global technology firms looking to power operations using renewable sources of energy. In March 2019, for example, Microsoft signed a 15-year power purchase agreement for the energy produced by a 74-megawatt solar power facility in North Carolina, while in April 2018 Apple announced its global facilities were powered using \\\"100 percent clean energy.\\\"Making sure that its facilities are powered by clean energy is a multi-faceted process for Apple.In its Environmental Responsibility Report covering the 2018 fiscal year the California-headquartered firm said that, where feasible, it sourced renewable energy by building its own projects. In addition, it invests capital to become a part owner in wind and solar projects and signs \\\"long-term renewable energy contracts.\\\"\",\n          \"The ongoing trade war President Donald Trump has waged against world powers, including some of our closest allies, doesn't show signs of slowing down.Left in the fray: Companies, American workers and consumers.The list of companies affected, either by planning to close plants, laying off employees, tossing out plans for new jobs or raising prices continues to grow.On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced it was escalating the battle with China by moving forward with a 25 percent tariff on $16 billion in Chinese goods. The tariffs will go into effect later this month.The end goal in Trump's eyes is for these countries to lower the tariffs they have on American goods, thus improving the market for the U.S. Some say his plan could work as the U.S. is negotiating from a position of strength -- a strong economy and low unemployment rates.But as the fight continues, some companies are having to absorb the blow.

Apple did not announce many details about the services, including pricing for TV+ and Arcade. But Munster says investors who focus on the missing details are missing the bigger picture.\\\"What Apple is saying is they are going to take things that we interact with every day -- whether it's the streaming service, gaming or our credit card \\u2013 and we're going to try to change in terms how people use that. The language that they use is 'enriching people's lives,'\\\" said Munster, founder of the venture capitalist firm Loup Ventures.That means creating content that isn't typical, gaming that's healthier, and a credit card that adds transparency, he added.\\\"That gets lost in the conversation today \\u2014 these subtle little approaches that Apple does to make our lives just a little bit better.

              "       'This commentary originally ran on Facebook. Boris Johnson – The former London mayor and grudging \"Leave\" supporter-turned enthusiastic \"Leave\" leader chose the winning side. He\\'s now a front-runner to lead the Tory party. \\u202a#\\u200eHellFreezesOver\\u202c Theresa May – Boris Johnson\\'s populist approach to the Brexit campaign ticked off quite a few Tory elders, so the real money should be on UK Home Secretary Theresa May to succeed outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron. May is a political heavyweight and is generally respected among the Tories, something Boris Johnson is … um, not.  Nigel Farage – the once-embattled UK Independence Party leader gets his moment in the sun. Also gets to keep having a political career. And the fact that he quoted \"Independence Day\" in his victory speech made a crazy night that much crazier.  Marine Le Pen/Geert Wilders – Charismatic figures with a long history agitating for EU exits, France\\'s Marine Le Pen and the Netherlands\\' Geert Wilders wasted no time calling for their own referendums. Brexit legitimizes their years of saber-rattling, and moves them from the political fringes into the mainstream, where they can do serious damage to the European project.  Vladimir Putin – Russia\\'s strongman needed this. Low oil prices have leveled the Russian economy, and the International Olympic Committee has banned Russian track athletes from competing at \\u202a#\\u200eRio2016\\u202c. But now he gets to say \"at least we\\'re not Europe.\"  Nicola Sturgeon – The head of the Scottish National Party delivered on her end from Scotland, where 62 percent of Scots voted to \"Remain,\" though turnout wasn\\'t as high as hoped. She now has political leverage by threatening to hold another Scottish referendum. And if Scotland leaves, the British drought at Wimbledon gets retroactively reinstated.  German/US relations – Going to get stronger. By default.  David Cameron – The man called the referendum to keep Euroskeptic Tories from defecting to the UK Independence Party camp in last year\\'s parliamentary election. That turns out to have bought him an extra year in 10 Downing Street. Hope it was worth it, David. \\u202a#\\u200eKarmaIsABitch\\u202c   British pollsters – whiffed on the Scottish referendum. Whiffed on last year\\'s parliamentary elections. Whiffed on the Brexit referendum. We were better off flipping a coin.   Alexis Tsipras – when the Greek Prime Minister held a referendum on whether the Greek people should sign a deal for more austerity, he just ignored the results. The fact that Cameron actually fell on his referendum sword makes Tsipras look silly. Oh, and Grexit is now a real possibility now that the precedent has been sent. Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn – Pundits have pointed to Labour\\'s particularly poor showing to get out the vote as a key reason why the \"Remain\" side failed to win. And Jeremy Corbyn just failed in his first real test as Labour leader. Labour has some soul-searching to do, though it feels like we say that after every election.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel – Brexit is now yet another problem for Europe (read: Merkel) to deal with. As if she didn\\'t have enough to worry over.   The British pound sterling – As the pound fell to levels not seen since 1985, maybe the first time ever that the British wish they had adopted the euro.   London\\'s financial sector – Despite the UK\\'s long-fraught relationship with the EU, it was clearly a net benefit for London\\'s financial sector, which could lay claim as the financial center of Europe. Much harder to do that when you\\'ve announced to the world you no longer want to be part of \"Europe.\" Look for Frankfurt to pick up the slack.   Donald J. Trump – Would have made him a winner, except he arrived in Scotland and announced that the Scottish \"took their country back.\" So many things factually incorrect in that one statement I don\\'t even know where to begin. Still, Brexit shows that divisive politics has an audience, which could bode well for The Donald.  Commentary by Ian Bremmer, the president and founder of Eurasia Group.

              "       'In spring, ambitious reforms began in Italy. Under Matteo Renzi, the ailing economy will either begin a real recovery, or slide further. The outcome is vital to Italy, Europe and the global economy.   Soon the name of Matteo Renzi, the new prime minister of Italy, will be known better internationally, after his meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Obama.    Along with French President François Hollande, the two know only too well what\\'s at stake in Italy\\'s recovery. If it succeeds, the recovery of the euro zone will slowly continue. If not, the implications will be global. The reform drive of il Rottamatore   One year after being sworn in as Mayor of Florence in 2009, Matteo Renzi declared that a complete change was necessary in his Democratic Party and Italian politics. So he was nicknamed il Rottamatore (\"The Scrapper\"). Last February, the 39-year-old Renzi became the youngest person in history to be Italy\\'s Prime Minister — even younger than Mussolini.   (Read more: France to ply China with wine)   But can the Great Scrapper reverse Italy\\'s economic decline?   First, the good news: In the end of 2013, only two months before Renzi arrived in Rome, the longest recession in Italy\\'s postwar history ended.    The bad news is that, after nine consecutive quarters of negative growth, the economy is almost 10 percent smaller than before the crisis. Meanwhile, business continues to complain about the tax burden, and the unemployment rate has doubled to over 12 percent since 2007. Despite pledges of austerity in Brussels and Rome, Italy\\'s fiscal deficit is 3 percent of the GDP and its sovereign debt has climbed to more than 132 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Among the EU members, only Greece has more.    The only bright spot is the current account surplus, which is almost 1 percent of the GDP. The positive turn stems from a higher contribution from net exports, coupled with a decline in imports. Nonetheless, it will be hard for Italian exporters to sustain their performance in the near future.    The economy suffers from a de facto process of de-industrialization. Industrial production has not increased ever since August 2011 and is now down 25 percent from its peak. Credit contraction weighs heavily on business confidence and consumer sentiment.   Ambitious programs — on a monthly basis   Today, Renzi\\'s Democratic Party, Partito Democratico (PD), has its strongest constituencies in Northern-Central Italy and the big cities. PD runs 12 Italian regions out of a total of 20. It is social-democratic, progressive by outlook, reformist by inclination.    Renzi himself is perceived as a liberal modernizer. When he became prime minister, it was a sign of much-needed generational change in the aging Italy, in which potential growth amounts to barely 0.8  to 1 percent in the coming years.    (Read more: Russia\\'s next step: Capitol controls?)   Italy needs huge structural and institutional reforms. Renzi hopes to reverse the country\\'s longstanding decline by launching one large project every month, starting with a new electoral law to consolidate political decision-making, reforms in the public administration, and the tax system.    Even before Italy\\'s European Council presidency will begin on July 1, 2014, Renzi hopes to achieve on a monthly basis what Rome\\'s political class has failed to achieve in decades. After Berlusconi\\'s rule, he sees Italy\\'s political landscape as devastated. Even before his premiership, he suggested that Italy\\'s parliamentarians should vote for their own removal. To become prime minister, Renzi politically maneuvered his predecessor Enrico Letta to resign.    Nonetheless, Renzi\\'s program will initiate the long-needed transformation of Italy. If this program will fall apart, the failure could push the economy deeper into the abyss.   Slow recovery — or devastating depression   In the past, the euro zone avoided a major crisis as long as friction points were restricted to small economies (e.g., Greece, Portugal, Ireland), which each accounted for less than 3 percent of the euro zone GDP.    Everything changed in fall 2011 when the contagion effect reached Spain and Italy, which together account for almost 30 percent of the regional GDP. If, under these circumstances, Greece would have defaulted, it could have caused a contagion effect, particularly in Italy. That is why Greece has now received two bailouts (73 billion euros and 164 billion euros), is in talks about a third one (up to 20 billion euros) and more generous repayment terms.    As long as Greece remains solvent, Italy and Spain will have time to restore sustained growth.   (Read more: ECB\\'s Weidmann says QE not out of the question)  The Italian economy remains vulnerable, however. Standard & Poor\\'s still has a negative outlook on the country\\'s \"BBB\" rating. Even by 2016, Italian economic output is likely to remain nearly 7 percent below 2007 levels. It is suffering from a \"lost decade.\"   The stakes are massive. Italy continues to account for 5 percent of gross commercial long-term debt globally, although its population is less than 1 percent of the world total.   While Brussels has demanded tough austerity programs, an exclusive focus on the latter would only make things worse in Italy. Instead, Renzi\\'s government is likely to reduce its huge debt only slowly, but focus on a lower deficit.    A failure to achieve progress would polarize Italy, destabilize Southern Europe and reduce global growth prospects.

They knew that these same kinds of automated cyberattacks were plaguing a wide variety of companies, leaving them unprepared when responding to a breach or, worse, preventing a future attack.Hexadite uses artificial intelligence to investigate and remediate every alert a company receives, claiming it can resolve incidents in seconds, freeing up a company's response team to focus on threats that truly need their expertise. Hexadite's Automated Incident Response Solution platform can integrate with customers' existing security technologies and can cut response time by 95 percent, the company says.Co-founder and CEO Eran Barak spent five years in an elite intelligence unit of the Israel Defense Forces before starting Hexadite in 2014 and was also head of Elbit Systems' cybertraining and simulation team. Late last year the company formed an alliance with other cybersecurity companies across the country, including Carbon Black, Check Point Software Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, to better integrate their products and automate important security processes.The goal of the alliance, explains Barak, is to utilize software to lighten the workload of security teams so that they can focus their time on the most dangerous and complex threats. The company has raised $10.5 million in funding from investors, including Hewlett Packard Ventures and TenEleven Ventures.\",\n",

              "       \"Major League Baseball spring training is underway and some of the biggest concerns about spending by teams headed into the MLB season have now been addressed, with roughly $1 billion spent on new player contracts within the last two weeks. On Thursday, all-star outfielder Bryce Harper signed a 13-year, $330 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies, the largest contract in MLB history in total value, though not per-year salary. The week previous, the San Diego Padres doled out $300 million over 10 years to Manny Machado. The Colorado Rockies also resigned Nolan Arenado to an eight-year, $260 million contract; the New York Yankees gave outfielder Aaron Hicks a seven-year, $70 million deal; and the St. Louis Cardinals starter Miles Mikolas received four years and $68 million.But bigger problems persist for the MLB: Attendance is down, games are still too long, and the gap between the richest and poorest teams remains wide, leading to a lack of competitiveness from many teams .Eight major league teams experienced double-digit attendance losses in 2018, led by the Miami Marlins' 52 percent decline — the laggard was no surprise, as the Marlins traded both 2017 National League Most Valuable Player Giancarlo Stanton to the New York Yankees and Christian Yelich to the Milwaukee Brewers (who went on to win the 2018 National League MVP award) before the season began, as part of the beginning of a long rebuilding process.Several currently successful teams embraced a rebuilding process, such as the 2017 World Series champion Houston Astros and 2016 World Series champion Chicago Cubs. The Padres will be another test case this season: The team inked the Machado deal after amassing what is widely regarded as one of the best farm systems in baseball, but also after close to a decade of consistently poor results on the field — the team has not had a winning record since 2010 and has not made the playoffs since 2006.Like the Padres' 66-96 record last season, there have been several other teams who have drowned in losses, mostly from stripping talent away, attempting to rebuild younger and cheaper rosters.

              "       'China\\'s retail sales growth surged in August to its quickest pace in more than three years, beating forecasts, but analysts said the jump largely reflected stronger inflation, not necessarily quicker underlying growth. Retail sales, which are tracked in nominal terms, grew 17.1% from a year earlier, compared with 16.4% in July. The uptick roughly tracked a rise in annual consumer inflation in August to 6.5%, from 5.6% in July. \"Retail sales growth is obviously strong. The problem is that the figures are being pushed up by the rising inflation as well. So actually, on a real basis, I don\\'t think there\\'s much of an acceleration,\" said Paul Cavey, an economist with Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong. August\\'s pace, the quickest since May 2004, beat economists\\' expectations of a 16.5% rise. Consumer inflation data, released on Tuesday, also surprised on the upside. Beijing would welcome an increase in real buying activity by the country\\'s consumers. It is trying to tilt its economy away from what economists call an unsustainable reliance on exports -- to the tune of 40% of national output. Not only does China\\'s gaping trade surplus -- it hit $25 billion in August -- contribute to tensions with its major trading partners, it also exposes it more to any downturn in the United States or other economies. Cavey said that a lynchpin of Beijing\\'s efforts to spur spending would be their effectiveness in the countryside, and that a recent epidemic among pigs was likely to blunt growth in spending there this year. \"We will expect retail sales growth to continue to be strong next year as the countryside gets over all this,\" he said. In the details, the retail sales data suggested a significant impact from the recent spike in food price inflation. Sales of grain and edible oils and meat, eggs and poultry, two of the categories where price rises have been most striking, rose 44% and 45.2%, respectively. Still, Lin Songli, senior economist at Guosen Securities in Beijing, said the figures showed that consumption was starting to take up a greater role in driving the world\\'s fastest-growing major economy. \"Consumption growth has not reached its peak yet, and we are now expecting even higher growth rates in coming months,\" Lin said.',\n",

              "       'China will take steps to contain a renewed burst in bank lending and a larger-than-expected rise in the country\\'s controversial trade surplus last month, senior officials said on Friday. Speaking on the sidelines of a annual parliamentary session, which ends on Friday, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said the authorities would place further controls on bank lending.\"From a commercial perspective, it is understandable for the banks to lend aggressively at the beginning of the year,\" Zhou told reporters. \"But from a macro perspective, after serious study, we decided to place further controls (on it),\" he said. He did not offer any timeframe. Lending data released this week reinforced concern that banks, awash with cash, may fund a new round of speculative investment. Lending surged by 413.8 billion yuan in February, compared with an increase of 149.1 billion yuan in February 2006. Separately, Commerce Minister Bo Xilai said the nation\\'s trade surplus had been \"too large\" in February and reaffirmed that Beijing planned new steps to trim exports and step up imports. China on Monday reported its second-biggest monthly trade surplus on record, dwarfing forecasts and handing fresh ammunition to critics who say Beijing is giving its exporters an unfair edge by holding down the yuan. The surplus for February ballooned to $23.76 billion, with exports leaping 51.7% from a year earlier. \"We are also very nervous about that,\" Bo said of the size of February\\'s surplus. \"We\\'re seriously studying the whole situation to find the underlying reasons.\" One reason for the surge was a propensity among Chinese firms to ship their goods out of the country to prevent them from being penalized by possible policy changes, he said. The Commerce ministry would make appropriate adjustments to the export tax rebate system, paying special attention to the area of processing trade as that generated the biggest portion of the surplus, Bo told reporters, without giving details. Zhou also said the authorities were keeping a wary eye on inflation, which he said had been running too high. Asked whether the central bank would raise interest rates soon, Zhou said they were seriously studying the inflation situation and would take \"appropriate measures\".',\n",

Speaking at the bank\\'s analyst day presentation, Charles \"Chuck\" Prince also said he shares investors\\' frustration with the bank\\'s lackluster share performance, but encouraged shareholders to be patient. \"I feel very good about the changes were making ... but there\\'s no short-cut to get from where we are to where we\\'re going,\" he said. Prince, under increasing pressure from investors, on Monday named a new chief operating officer at the bank and promised an increased focus on costs. During Thursday\\'s presentation, Prince discussed ways Citigroup aims to increase revenue, including expanding its financial advisory business and increasing its private banking efforts. Increased revenue and lower investment spending should help Citigroup\\'s revenue grow faster than expenses next year, and profits grow faster than revenue, Prince said. That \"positive operating leverage\" would reverse a trend this year of operating expense growth outpacing revenue growth. Citigroup\\'s relatively weak earnings growth has weighed on its shares, which are up 8.7% so far this year, lagging an 11.6% gain in the KBW Bank index for the same period. Investors gave a moderate vote of confidence to Prince\\'s latest prescriptions for the bank\\'s ills, boosting Citigroup shares by 0.8% and making them one of the session\\'s top gainers in the sector index. \"That (cut in 2007 investment spending) is giving investors confidence thatthere may be operating leverage in 2007 after not seeing a lot of operating leverage in the last couple of years,\" said Sam Rahman, portfolio manager at Baring Asset Management Inc. in Boston, which owns Citigroup shares. \"I think that\\'s what investors are keying off on.\"Overseas GrowthOthers remained skeptical. \"It\\'s more of the same,\" said William Smith, chief executive of SAMAdvisors, LLC, which owns Citigroup stock. \"In our opinion, it\\'s disturbing that he (Prince) does not understand what\\'s going on. He is losing the battle here as far as what shareholders want.\" Smith said Citigroup shares had been bolstered last week by talk that the bank could replace Chief Financial Officer Sallie Krawcheck or even Prince, or could spin off some units. Prince said revenue growth in the U.S. consumer bank was taking longer than he had expected, but he was cautiously optimistic about it improving. The company is taking steps like combining its brokerage and bank franchises, in an effort to offer more products to customers. Prince said the company was unlikely to make any large U.S. bank acquisitions in 2007, reiterating that there were better opportunities to buy businesses overseas. Citigroup on Wednesday agreed to acquire Central American commercial and retail bank Grupo Cuscatlan for $1.51 billion and last month led a team of investors that won control of China\\'s Guangdong Development Bank with a bid of 24.3 billion yuan ($3.1 billion). Citigroup is budgeting for moderate deterioration in credit quality for 2007, Prince said. Prince, who met with analysts alongside chief-operating-officer-to-be Robert Druskin, Krawcheck and other executives, also said Citigroup could boost credit loss reserves in Japan due to legislative changes.',\n",
              "       'By Jan Strupczewski   BRUSSELS, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers willlaunch their 500 billion euro ($653.00 billion) permanentbailout fund on Monday, putting in place a major defence againstthe debt crisis that now threatens Spain.   The fund, called the European Stability Mechanism (ESM),will be used to lend to distressed euro zone sovereigns inreturn for strict fiscal and structural reforms that aim to puteconomies that have lost investor trust back on track.   It is part of the single currency area\\'s drive for anoverhaul of its economic structures and deeper integration, adiscussion that will be taken forward on Monday with talks on anidea to create a single euro-zone budget.   Euro zone finance ministers, who form the ESM\\'s board ofgovernors, will hold their inaugural meeting in Luxembourg twoyears after EU leaders endorsed the idea of setting up such apermanent institution.   \"The ESM will be operational as of Monday,\" said a euro zoneofficial, linked to the ESM.   The fund\\'s lending capacity will be based on 80 billioneuros of paid-in capital and 620 billion of callable capital,against which the ESM will borrow money on the market to lend iton to governments cut off from sustainable market funding.   It will reach its full capacity gradually by 2014.   Its first task will be to lend to Spain for therecapitalisation of its banking sector, hit hard by a collapseof the real estate market - a programme inherited from thetemporary European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).   Madrid is likely to ask for about 40 billion euros torecapitalise its banks following independent assessments of thesectors\\' needs -- well within the 100 billion euros set aside byeuro zone finance ministers for the purpose in July.   The ESM money would flow to Spain in November, afterEuropean Commission competition authorities approve conditionsfor the recapitalisation for each bank.   SPAIN IN FOCUS   Spain is in investors\\' focus because it has struggled to cutone of the euro zone\\'s largest public deficits as the countrysinks deeper into its second recession in three years.   In Luxembourg, euro zone ministers will also discuss arequest, expected from Spain sometime in the coming weeks, for aprecautionary credit line from the ESM that they hope will boostinvestor confidence and keep Madrid in the capital markets.   A euro zone source said they may also discuss Spain\\'s tough2013 budget, outlined last month, which the InternationalMonetary Fund and the European Commission both believe is basedon an over-optimistic forecast of a 0.5 percent economiccontraction next year. The current IMF forecast of a 1.2 percentrecession may be revised further downwards on Tuesday.   A revised budget based on updated IMF and EU forecasts maybe one condition for assistance from the ESM.   Such a programme would likely entail the issuance offirst-loss guarantees on bonds sold by Spain at auction, or somesimilar form of rescue to bolster Madrid\\'s credibility.   Guaranteeing the first 20-30 percent loss on new Spanishbonds would allow - through leveraging - all of Spain\\'s 207billion debt issuance in 2013 to be made much more attractive toinvestors using roughly 50 billion euros of euro zone money.   Such an amount would fit comfortably within the 100 billionlimit already approved by parliaments for the bank rescue incountries with strong anti-bailout sentiment like Germany andFinland, making it politically more palatable, even iftechnically it would remain a separate operation.   A credit line for Spain would also open the way forpurchases of Spanish bonds on the secondary market by theEuropean Central Bank -- a prospect that has lowered Spanishyields already from above 7 percent in July to below 5.72 now.   But Germany opposes a Spanish bailout request now, becauseit would prefer to bundle Spain with a request for a small, 15billion euro bailout for Cyprus and a revision of the second,130 billion euro bailout for Greece in one crisis-solvingpackage later this year.   This would allow German Chancellor Angela Merkel, wary ofshaky support for bailouts in her own ruling coalition, to pushthe large crisis package through parliament in one go, ratherthan fight separate battles for each.   As a result, a Spanish request is unlikely for a few weeks.   The ministers will also take stock of the efforts of Greeceto unblock payments from the second bailout agreed in Februaryafter reforms in the debt-laden country stalled because of twogeneral elections in May and June.

              "       'Those tuning into the Grammys may have caught a glimpse of a television milestone, and it didn’t happen on stage at the music awards show.Absolut vodka debuted a new ad, marking the first time a spirits brand aired a commercial during the Grammys. More importantly, it was also a first for spirits advertising in prime time in several CBS markets. The ad, which ran in 15 of the largest media markets on many CBS-owned-and-operated stations, is a breakthrough for the spirits industry, which has been rebuffed in its attempts to buy airtime on the major networks in the past. No doubt, the proliferation of advertisements on cable stations and local network affiliates has laid the groundwork for this event. “We’re not surprised, it’s been a steady progression,” said Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, an industry trade group. Coleman said the television advertising of spirits brands has built steadily over the past decade, although it has leveled off more recently as companies have spent more of their ad budget online. Absolut, a Swedish vodka brand that was purchased by Pernod Ricard last year, has long been known for its memorable advertising. “I think we continue to take an innovative approach to media and advertising,” said Ian Crystal, brand director of Absolut Vodka at Pernod Ricard USA. According to Crystal, there wasn’t any resistance at CBS and its affiliates. He attributes this to the “iconic” nature of the Absolut brand. For the first 25 years, the brand’s image was built around print advertising that centered on the distinctive shape of its bottle. But the campaign shifted in May 2007, with the launch of the “In An Absolut World” campaign. Now about 30 percent to 40 percent of the brand’s ad budget is spent on television and film advertising. According to Crystal, the campaign’s concept is about ideas, which translate well on film, and therefore lends itself to television advertising. The latest incarnation of the campaign is the “Hugs” spot, which depicts scenes from an idealized world. As the music of Louis Armstrong plays, people from around the world exchange hugs and other signs of affection rather than currency. The 30-second spot, created by ad agency TBWAChiatDay, will continue to air on broadcast and cable in seven key markets over the next week. Events like the Grammys are often used by advertisers as a way of reaching a mass audience joined by a common interest. Music is a leading interest among adults 21 years to 24 years old, who are Absolut’s key demographic. Last year, the Grammy Awards reached an estimated 17 million viewers. Ratings for Sunday’s show were not immediately available. More from Consumer Nation:Questions? Comments? Email us at consumernation@cnbc.com',\n",
              "       'After six years of discussion, the Keystone pipeline is finally  going to get an up or down vote on the U.S. Senate floor,  confirming the adage, elections have consequences. What led to  this change? Politics.  On Wednesday, Sen. Mary Landrieu, the embattled  Democrat, facing a Dec. 6 runoff, called on the Senate to  put the Keystone pipeline issue up for a vote. She was pushing  for this to be the first order of business in the lame-duck  session of Congress.  In quick turn, the Democratic leadership blessed the gambit, in  what political reporters on Capitol Hill are calling the \"Hail  Mary\" to save Landrieu\\'s Senate seat. The idea is to get her name  on the bill that approves the pipeline, which is very popular in  her home state of Louisiana, where she is behind in in the polls. Late Wednesday the Republican leadership announced they had a  deal with Democrats for a vote as early as Tuesday. How did the  decisions to vote next week happen? Politics.    When House leadership got wind of the Hail Mary, they quickly  crafted a Keystone pipeline bill to hit the House floor this  week. The author of the bill is listed as Rep. Bill Cassidy, the  Republican congressman from Louisiana and the candidate facing  Landrieu in the Dec. 6 runoff election for the Senate  seat. Read MoreEconomics no longer makes Keystone  pipeline viable  The political calculus goes something like this: Passing the  Cassidy bill on the House floor this week will give him top  billing in the news cycles through the weekend and the final bill  will likely bear both of their names. In addition to the timing  issues, the bill will need 60 votes to overcome procedural  hurdles. Until now the best Keystone had done was 54 votes. This  means passage will require six Democrats to flip their votes,  something the Republican supporters of Cassidy look forward to  pointing out to anyone who will listen.',\n",

Both totals were the best either automaker had seen since 2007, before the U.S. economy went into recession and caused a drastic decline in sales that led GM and Chrysler to file for bankruptcy in 2009.Still, results of Ford, Chrysler and Toyota came in below expectations, while GM missed some analysts' estimates, suggesting that the U.S. industry will have a hard time reaching the 14.9 million-vehicle annual sales rate economists had predicted for the month before Sandy pummeled the U.S. East Coast.  Auto sales are an early indicator each month of U.S. consumer demand.The massive storm, which hit New York City on Monday evening, hurt U.S. demand at the end of the month, with Ford officials estimating the lost sales for the entire industry at 20,000 to 25,000 vehicles.Ford officials said that would hurt the annual rate by 300,000 vehicles, although analysts have said the industry would likely make up any lost sales in November. GM officials agreed, saying Sandy hurt the annual rate by at least 300,000 vehicles.GM said it sees an October annual sales rate in the range of 14.4 million vehicles. Ford estimates the rate in the high 14 million range including heavy and medium-duty trucks, in line with GM.Volkswagen AG's U.S. operations chief, Jonathan Browning, said the industry would fall short of the 10 to 11 percent gain many had predicted.``This is not yet a full-blown recovery,'' Browning told reporters on a conference call. ``The overall environment is one of improving optimism, but it's still not a strong positive development in terms of the overall economy.'' He added that demand had been choppy in some regions even before Sandy.Before the massive storm hit, analysts had predicted the industry would show an 11 percent sales gain, led by Toyota and Honda Motor Co, which benefited from increased demand for compact cars as gasoline prices remained high across the country.Many automakers still made gains in the month as rising home prices, attractive vehicle financing options and Americans' growing need to replace their aging cars spurred more consumers to showrooms. That bodes well for the future, a top GM executive said.``Year over year, the light vehicle selling rate has increased for eight consecutive quarters without a tailwind from the residential housing sector, but that is starting to change,'' Kurt McNeil, GM's vice president of U.S. sales operations, said in a statement. ``If these trends continue, housing may be the final piece of the puzzle that lifts sales above 15 million units on an annual basis.''Over the last five years, the U.S. auto sector has undergone a wrenching overhaul that led to plant closures, job losses and the government-financed bankruptcy restructurings of GM and Chrysler. Ford also overhauled its U.S. operations, but did not take a government bailout.The October sales report will be the last before Election Day, marking the end of a contentious U.S. presidential race that has repeatedly thrust GM and Chrysler into the spotlight in televised debates, stump speeches and campaign advertisements.The sales report also caps a busy week for the U.S. auto industry, which saw third-quarter profit reports from all three Detroit automakers.GM shares were down 0.6 percent at $25.34 on Thursday morning, while Ford shares were down 1.4 percent at $11.00. The broad S&P 500 Index  was up 1 percent.(Additional reporting by Paul Lienert and Deepa Seetharaman in Detroit; editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Matthew Lewis)\",\n",

AGL said in a statement that it was also negotiating with Babcock & Brown to acquire the retail business, but stated that it has not entered an agreement with either party. AlintaAGL, spun off in an asset swap deal between AGL and Alinta last year, is a joint venture company that holds Alinta's Western Australia retail and generation businesses. Macquarie Bank said in a separate statement that it was still considering acquiring Alinta, which had put itself up for sale after receiving a management buyout proposal in January. Local media reported on Friday that Macquarie was close to submitting a revised A$15.45 a share, all-cash offer for Alinta.\\xa0 Macquarie's first offer in March was a A$15.45 per share cash and scrip bid. Alinta's board had rejected the proposal, saying\\xa0 the deal included shares in an untested new vehicle. Under the agreement with AGL, Macquarie would sell to AGL the AlintaAGL power retailing business AGL does not already own in exchange for AGL agreeing to sell to Macquarie its interests in several Alinta generators, according to newspaper reports. Macquarie may be planning to use the proceeds of any AGL deal, which could be about A$400 million, to fund a cash return to Alinta shareholders as part of a sweetened offer. A source familiar with the situation said there was a Friday deadline for Macquarie to return information it had access to on Alinta, but that did not mean it had to submit an offer by Friday. Another source said Macquarie was still working on finalizing an underwriting package for a bid. Babcock offered Alinta shareholders A$8.50 in cash per share as well as 7.83 shares of Babcock & Brown Infrastructure, 1.30 shares of Babcock & Brown Wind, 3.31 shares of Babcock & Brown Power and 1.51 Australia Pipeline Trust units for every five Alinta shares. In a bid to sweeten the deal, Babcock, which has teamed up with state-owned utility Singapore Power, said on April 16 it would offer shareholders with 1,000 Alinta shares or less the opportunity to receive all cash.\",\n",

              "       'The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday blasted the Trump administration for claiming in a new report that it had authority to order the controversial killing last month of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Iraq under Congress\\' authorization in 2002 for the use of military force against Iraq.Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the committee\\'s chairman, argued that the administration\\'s new report to Congress about the Jan. 3 attack on Soleimani \"directly contradicts the President\\'s false assertion that he attacked Iran to prevent an imminent attack against United States personnel and embassies.\"\"The administration\\'s explanation in this report makes no mention of any imminent threat and shows that the justification the President offered to the American people was false, plain and simple,\" said Engel in a prepared statement.He and other Democrats already were skeptical about President Donald Trump\\'s legal rationale for the attack without prior authorization from Congress.The administration\\'s report made public Friday says that Trump \"directed this action in response to an escalating series of attacks in preceding months by Iran and Iran-back militias on United States forces and interests in the Middle East region.\"The report also said that the attack on Soleimani at Baghdad\\'s airport was \"consistent with\" a \"longstanding interpretation of the President\\'s authority\" under both Article II of the Constitution and the 2002 authorization of use of force in Iraq.Engel, in his statement, called that argument \"absurd.\"\"To make matters worse, to avoid having to justify its actions to Congress, the administration falsely claims Congress had already authorized the strike under the 2002 Iraq war resolution,\" Engel said.\"This legal theory is absurd. The 2002 authorization was passed to deal with Saddam Hussein,\" he said. \"This law had nothing to do with Iran or Iranian government officials in Iraq.\"The chairman added, \"To suggest that 18 years later this authorization could justify killing an Iranian official stretches the law far beyond anything Congress ever intended. I was pleased to join many of my colleagues in voting to repeal the outdated Iraq war authorization, and I hope the Senate will follow suit.\"In its report, the administration said the purpose of the attack on Soleimani was \"to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks against United States forces and interests, to degrade Iran\\'s and [its] Qods Force-backed militias\\' ability to conduct attacks, and to end Iran\\'s strategic escalation of attacks on, and threats to U.S. interests.\"At the time of his death, Soleimani, 62, was commander of Iran\\'s Quds Force, the foreign operations wing of the elite paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Trump administration officials said after the strike that Soleimani had been planning imminent attacks on Americans and as a result had to be stopped.A week after his killing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, \"There was no doubt that there were a series of imminent attacks that were being plotted by Qasem Soleimani.\"But Pompeo, in an interview with Fox News, added, \"We don\\'t know precisely when and we don\\'t know precisely where, but it was real,\" Pompeo said in an interview that aired Thursday night on Fox News.NBC News reported in mid-January that Trump authorized Soleimani\\'s killing seven months before he actually was killed.\"The presidential directive in June came with the condition that Trump would have final signoff on any specific operation to kill Soleimani,\" NBC reported, citing five current and former senior administration officials.NBC News noted that the timing of that directive \"could undermine\" the administration\\'s already publicly stated rationale for the killing.',\n",

              "       \"Nonfarm payrolls rose 287,000 in June, significantly more than expected according to the median consensus on Bloomberg, and certainly a welcome improvement from the minimal rise last month.  May, in fact, was revised down further from 38,000 to just 11,000.  Taking the Verizon strike into account, adding 35,000 to May and subtracting 35,000 from June, the last two months of payroll gains are more like 46,000 and 252,000 respectively.   Still, the improvement at the end of the second-quarter does little to reinstate a positive trajectory in hiring – remember it's not about just one or two months data, it is about the trend pace.  The three-month average rose from 115,000 to 140,000 in June, down markedly, however, from a near 300,000 pace at the end of 2015 when the Fed opted to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years.  In other words, while the Fed's preemptive policy adjustment was based on expectations of further improvement in the labor market and inflation, the data have still-failed to evolve as expected.    The unemployment rate ticked up from 4.7 percent to 4.9 percent in June as nearly half a million workers moved back into the labor force – nearly the same amount that dropped out the month prior.  Household employment rose, however, by only 67k in June prompting a rise in the unemployment rate, as well as the participation rate from 62.6 percent to 62.7 percent.  Average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent in June, enough, however, to boost the annual pace of earnings up to 2.6 percent, a new high for 2016.  If sustained, which is itself a big if, positive, above-trend earnings growth would offer the Federal Reserve at least one strong indication of continued improvement in the U.S. labor market.  As of late, however, it is still too soon to suggest a sustainable upward trend as wages have been increasingly volatile month-to-month.  Finally, the workweek remains unchanged at 34.4 in June, as if has for the past five months.  Here's the bottom line:  Prior to the violent reaction in the financial markets following the Brexit, several Committee members noted the downside risks to the Fed's outlook for growth in economic activity and for further improvement in labor market conditions.  This morning's June employment report, while a welcome improvement from a disappointing rise in May, has done little to help quell the Committee's well-founded concerns surrounding labor market strength or the market's concerns of a recession over the next 12-24 months.  After all, although the headline increase in May was severely disappointing and seemingly an anomaly, the pace of hiring has been slowing for some time.  Near 300,000 at the end of last year, the three-month average slowed to fewer than 200,000 in the first quarter before dropping to just above 100,000 as of late.  Thus, even the outsized nominal rise in June of 287,000, beating market expectations, is not enough to reestablish an improving trend in hiring.  Rather, a still-weakened trajectory will continue to fuel the Committee's concerns surrounding the underlying momentum of the U.S. labor market, and the domestic economy as a whole, into the second-half of the year and beyond, perpetuating the Fed's inability to raise rates anytime soon.  In other words, if rates were poised to stay low for longer, the Fed's acknowledgement of recent weakness on the domestic front coupled with global market volatility suggest rates are now likely to be much lower for much, much, much longer.

              "       'In mimicking Robert F. Kennedy\\'s 1967 tour through impoverished American communities, John Edwards strikes a resonant chord with me. My father covered that Kennedy trip for the Washington Post. A photo from that experience hangs on the wall in the kitchen of my family home. But is he the Bobby Kennedyof the 2008 presidential race?Certainly the former North Carolina senator would like to be--and with good reason. RFK, in a different way than his brother JFK,has become a mythic Democratic hero. He had an ability to appeal across racial and income lines in ways any thinking Democrat could want to emulate. Some of the comparisons are apt. John Edwards has drawn flak forhis work with the Fortress Investment Group hedge fundand his $400 haircuts. Kennedy was a rich man too. Notwithstanding our sustained economic growth and booming stock market, poverty rates remain comparable to levels of a generation ago; in the most recent Census Data, from 2005, slightly more than 12 percent of the population is poor. The poverty population has become younger, as Medicare and Social Security have dramatically reduced economic deprivation among the elderly. Poverty among whites has fallen substantially, but they represent a declining proportion of the overall population. Just as RFK was in his day, Edwards stands widely accused of political opportunism. He likes to say that he\\'s emphasizing poverty issues against the prevailing wisdom of political consultants, since there\\'s little political upside in appealing to the poor when middle class votes and upscale executives\\' political contributions drive U.S. elections. In fact, there\\'s a very large political benefit in championing the poor among Democratic primary voters. But Edwards has at least three big problems in trying to replicate Kennedy\\'s political feat. One is that Barack Obama--the first African American candidate with a real shot at becoming president -- is for many voters already filling the RFK roles for many voters of both races. A second is that immigration has made Hispanic voters a growing proportion of the Democratic primary electorate, and so far Hispanic voters have flocked to Hillary Clinton. The third is that the composition of the Democratic electorate has changed. Many of the blue-collar Democrats Kennedy appealed to are now Republicans, drawn by the GOP\\'s appear on social issues or security concerns. That leaves Democrats more dependent than ever on both the top of the income scale as well as the bottom; Democrats nearly broke even in 2006 among voters earning more than $100,000 a year. Edwards aims to appeal to both upscale and downscale voters at the same time. Despite his work at Fortress, he led other top Democratic candidates in embracing higher taxes on private equity and hedge fund managers. He\\'s also pushing universal health care and a tougher line on U.S. trade policy. One early sign of the viability of his strategy will come in his third quarter fund-raising. So far he boasts some loyal allies from American business; wealthy telecommunications executive Leo Hindery is a top economic adviser. Tune in to CNBC\\'s \"Street Signs\" this afternoon at 2:30, and we\\'ll explore Hindery\\'s assessment of the top populist in the Democratic race.

VMware, Fastly and Newmont Mining were substituted for Baxter International, GlaxoSmithKline and Kellogg.Baxter, a medical supplies company, was removed because of its high exposure to voluntary surgeries delayed by the impact of the health crisis on hospitals. GlaxoSmithKline, a drug company that\\'s working on a Covid-19 vaccine, was taken off because the stock is \"not enticing many investors,\" Cramer said. Kellogg, the cereal producing giant, was axed because the stock is lagging and the Cramer index already contains seven other similar plays.As for the new additions, Cramer added VMware, one of his cloud king stocks, because the stock is \"cheap on an earnings basis\" and the prospect that the company could be spun off from Dell. Fastly, a cloud content delivery network whose stock price has increased sevenfold since bottoming in March, is one that in hindsight Cramer wishes he included when he created the index in April. Newmont is a gold company that can provide investors \"more insurance against economic chaos\" as the country continues to deal with fallout from the coronavirus crisis, he said.The biggest winners on Crammer\\'s list – Zoom Video, Spotify, Zscaler, DocuSign, Etsy, The Trade Desk, Livongo Health, Square, Peloton and Cloudflare – are among the top plays in the stay-at-home economy.\"As the pandemic flares up again, get ready after the industrial rotation ends.

(Stewart himself has a  deal with HBO that he\\'ll presumably start producing content for  one of these days.)  But something else happened in those 351 days: Donald Trump  became the Republican party\\'s nominee for president.

              "       'Homes today are selling in about 40 days on average, almost two weeks faster than a year ago. But it is taking a lot longer for shoppers to find a home to buy.Two-thirds of buyers are shopping for more than three months before signing a deal, according to a new survey from the National Association of Home Builders. Why so long? They can\\'t find a home they can afford.Forty-two percent of buyers surveyed said prices were out of reach for the homes they wanted. Home prices have been rising at a fast clip in the past year – faster than income growth and inflation. The primary reason is a lack of homes for sale, especially lower-priced homes.\"It\\'s the inventory problem that we\\'re having out there that is causing these long delays in pulling the trigger,\" said Rose Quint, assistant vice president for survey research at the NAHB. \"It\\'s lack of affordability, although the other problems are serious as well.\"About a third of those surveyed said they couldn\\'t find a home with features they wanted or in a neighborhood they wanted. Back to prices though, 27 percent said they kept getting outbid on their offers. Bidding wars are now the rule, not the exception, in most major U.S. markets.Home prices rose in 92 percent of the nation\\'s measured housing markets at the end of last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. Twenty-six markets (15 percent) saw double-digit increases in prices. That was more than in the third quarter.\"These consistent, multiyear price gains have certainly been great news for homeowners, and especially for those who were at one time in a negative equity situation,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. \"However, the shortage of new homes being built over the past decade is really burdening local markets and making home buying less affordable.\"The lack of supply should benefit the homebuilders, and it may be already. Mortgage applications to purchase a newly built home jumped 18 percent in January compared with a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\"This complements other positive news on U.S. job growth suggesting that economic fundamentals are strong,\" said Lynn Fisher, MBA vice president of research and economics, in a release. \"Based on applications, we estimate that new home sales were running at a pace of 700,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis – the highest such estimate in our survey which began in 2013.\"The jump in demand is sizable, but the number of new homes for sale is still below historical averages and far below the number needed to satisfy both new and pent-up demand. The largest generation, millennials, are now moving into their homebuying years in force, but clearly not finding what they can afford.\"The whole industry has been clamoring for builders to increase their production, but they\\'re trying,\" said Quint. \"The prices of lumber and labor and land are increasing so fast, they\\'re constrained at the bottom, at how low a price they can really achieve.\"The NAHB is predicting a 5 percent increase in new home construction in 2018 compared with 2017.

              "       'Stocks held their own Monday, even after the shocking demise of Bear Stearns. But the market no doubt benefited from the view of many investors that the Fed will deliver a hefty rate cut when it meets Tuesday. Right now, traders are betting on a full point rate cut by the Fed, which would take the target Fed funds rate to 2 percent. Just Friday, the Fed funds futures showed traders believed the Fed would cut by 0.75 percent. But the weekend rescue of Bear Stearns in a Fed-engineered buyout by JP Morgan  and other extraordinary moves by the Fed changed that view. Two investment banks report earnings before the bell Tuesday, and that news will also be key in setting the course for markets. Other important news includes producer price inflation data, due at 8:30 a.m., and housing starts, also reported at 8:30 a.m. One of the most encouraging events for stocks in recent sessions is the pricing Tuesday afternoon of the giant $18 billion Visa IPO. The offering is expected to price after the bell Tuesday, and start trading Wednesday. There has been some real investor excitement about the offering, which is expected to price between $37 and $42 per share. Earnings CentralGoldman  is expected to report first quarter earnings of $2.58 per share, a decline of 61 percent, on revenues of $7.47 billion, a 41 percent decline. Lehman is expected to report earnings per share of $0.72, a 63 percent decline, on revenues of $3.351 billion, a 34 percent decrease. The shares of financial institutions were under pressure Monday after the Bear Stearns news, with Wall Street\\'s investment banks particularly hard hit. The S&P financial sector was down 1.5 percent. Lehman stock was the most tattered of all the firms as an uncomfortable level of rumors swirled around its shares. The stock at some points during the day was down more than a third, and it traded on volume of 224 million shares, nearly eight times its 10 day average of 33 million shares. Lehman battled back. CEO Richard Fuld said in a statement that the Fed\\'s announcement Sunday that it would allow investment banks to use its discount window takes the liquidity issue \"off the table for the entire industry.\" Previously, commercial banks were the only institutions that could use the Fed\\'s short term borrowing window. Traders said the Fed\\'s rule change was a big reason why stock trading was so orderly Monday. Lehman\\'s CFO Erin Callan is expected to appear on \"Closing Bell\" Tuesday. Chop, ChopDeutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Joe LaVorgna is one who changed his view on the Fed and rate cuts over the weekend. He now expects a full point rate cut when the Fed announces its decision at 2:15 p.m. \"The only way I could see the Fed not going 100 (a full point) is if they accompany the 75 cut with their intention to purchase GSE debt, Fannie and Freddie debt,\" he said. Speaking of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the Wall Street Journal was reporting late Monday that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight is close to reducing capital requirements for the two companies, a move that would give the firms more flexibility in buying mortgages. \"Look at the Fed\\'s action. They basically are telling you they are going to do something dramatic. I don\\'t think 0.75 is particularly dramatic anymore. I think it has been priced into the market,\" he said. LaVorgna said the Fed\\'s statement will likely note that there\\'s still downside risk. \"The Fed is not going to worry about inflation. It\\'s going to worry about growth...we\\'re not out of the woods yet,\" he said. Market MayhemThe Dow finished 21 points higher at 11,972, after a nearly 200 point swoon. The Dow is now down 9.9 percent since the start of the year and 2.1 percent from a year ago. The Nasdaq though was bloodied in Monday\\'s trading, scoring a 1.6 percent, or 35 point decline. Nasdaq is down 18 percent year-to-date and is off 9.1 percent in the past 52 weeks. The S&P 500 slipped 11 points to 1276, a level 13 percent below where it started the year. The Bear Stearns story ratcheted up anxiety about risk in the market, despite equities relatively tame reaction. Treasury yields fell as buyer moved into the safety of Treasurys. The 10-year was yielding 3.314 percent, and the yield on the two-year slipped to 1.333 percent, its lowest level since July, 2003. The dollar continued its weakening trend, losing 0.5 percent against the Euro  and 2 percent against the yen . Some of the real action though was in the commodities markets where sellers dumped energy, grains and metals (with the exception of gold). Gold finished at $1001.40 per troy ounce, up 0.3 percent.Crude oil  fell 4.1 percent to $105.68 a barrel. Gasoline fell 6.9 percent and natural gas fell 7.8 percent. Silver fell 1.7 percent, copper fell 3.5 percent. Soybeans, corn and wheat all fell sharply and sugar and coffee fell more than 10 percent. Joseph Terranova, partner at Thelogicaltrader.net, said commodities prices could get a lift from the Fed\\'s rate action Tuesday, but watch out Wednesday and Thursday. \"When market conditions get like they did this morning, you need to pare back and take a fresh look,\" said Terranova. He said it\\'s time to reduce some risk from portfolios, but investors should look to add to positions heading into the second quarter. He expects commodities to be flattish for a while. \"I\\'m going to wait and see what Bernanke gives the street. I\\'ll come back a week from today and we\\'ll be putting stuff back in place ...

Protesters say the results were rigged, and\\xa0some have explained to Associated Press journalists exactly how the fraud took place in their districts.Lukashenko has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994, regularly repressing dissent and press freedom.Police violently cracked down on demonstrators in the first days of the protests, arresting some 7,000 people and beating hundreds. Although they have scaled back, detentions continue; Viasna reported scores of people were arrested in Minsk and in the city of Grodno on Sunday.Police and army troops blocked off the center of Minsk on Sunday, but demonstrators marched to the outskirts of the Palace of Independence, the president\\'s working residence 3 kilometers (2 miles) outside the city center. The palace grounds were blocked off by phalanxes of shield-bearing riot police and water cannon.\"This sea of \\u200b\\u200bpeople cannot be stopped by military equipment, water cannons, propaganda and arrests. Most Belarusians want a peaceful change of power and we will not get tired of demanding this,\" said Maria Kolesnikova, a leader of the Coordination Council set up by the opposition to try to arrange a dialogue with the 66-year-old Lukashenko about a transition of power.She spoke with The Associated Press by telephone.Lukashenko has rejected any discussion with the council and some of its top members have been jailed. One of them, Olga Kovalova, was expelled from the country over the weekend, driven to Poland by police.Despite the stalemate between Lukashenko and the opposition, protesters say they are determined not to tire. Some of the placards they carried Sunday showed a lively sense of humor.',\n",

              "       \"A shift in economic growth from the West to emerging markets over the past decade has led to the emergence of new business hubs across the world.Regions such as Asia, the Middle East and South America have seen rapid economic growth, coupled with improved infrastructure, and in some cases, lighter regulation. Multinational organizations have rushed to capitalize on this, increasing the number of people they hire in these countries and setting up new offices in emerging markets. For example, banks including HSBC and Barclays have said they will increase hiring in Asia, while cutting staff in developed markets. GE, for example, has moved the headquarters of its X-ray business to Beijing from the U.S.The emergence of these new business centers has sometimes come at the expense of the traditional centers such as New York, Frankfurt and London. But it hasn't always been smooth. Dubai, which experienced huge investments in real estate over the past decade, faced a property bust in 2009.We decided to look at the top business hubs in the world based on research by global real estate firm CB Richard Ellis, which surveyed 300 of the world's largest companies, including Fortune 500 firms and other non-listed entities, such as law firms. The ranking is based on what percentage of these companies have offices in these cities.We've matched that with the cost of renting office space in the central business districts (CBDs) of these hubs from real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield.

              "       'Over the years, when the market has gotten really wacky, tense and emotional, I have tended to always check in with the king of momentum investing: William O’Neil — or at least his organization, which includes Investors Business Daily. I’ve actually never talked to O’Neil, but I’ve often been surprised to hear they were long gone from (or certainly cautious on) some of the biggest momentum names when the market — or at least a cluster of names — has appeared to have gotten out of control. That’s when companies go from being just companies to being stocks. With that in mind, what’s the current state of momentum? Depends when you ask. “The first thing we always look at is the direction of the market, and it’s unclear at this point.” Chris Gessel, executive editor of IBD, has worked with O’Neil for 15 years and serves as the front man to people like me. We were talking late Tuesday morning — and at that point he was saying: Enter later in the afternoon, after the market closed. I checked back with Gessel and (surprise!) he had an update – proving just how unpredictable this market has become: “We’re changing our outlook back to an uptrend because of the action of the leaders,” he said. Does that mean the choppy and unclear nature of the market — with indexes in conflict with the leaders — is moot? “It’s not entirely resolved” Gessel said. “But the leaders are acting very well and the market is okay. Today’s positive reversal and close right near the high after last week’s positive action is getting hard to ignore.” What about the hottest stocks? Some of the big movers like Netflix, OpenTable, Chipotle and Apple are at points where Gessel says the O’Neil model might not commit new money “at this point.” (It tends to wait for the stock to start moving again with confirming volume.) \"The big easier gains have passed and a lot more diligence and disciplined trading is required. You need to buy at the right point.\" On the other hand, AthenaHealthis starting to show up on the O’Neil radar, thanks to accelerating sales and earnings. “It’s a fairly new stock for us,” Gessel says. “But it had been going sideways for four years.” Even though it’s nearly double its summer lows, Gesssel says, “You wouldn’t look at this and call this a momentum stock.” Not yet, at least. My take: Never forget the part about growth stocks and their exaggerated ties to the market. The markets may come and go but that never changes – both ways! Questions? Comments?

Specifically, the company now offers ETFs tracking the  S&P 500 ex-energy (trading under the ticker symbol SPXE), ex-financials  (SPXN), ex-health  care (SPXV) and  ex-technology (SPXT).   In a Thursday interview with CNBC\\'s \"Trading Nation,\" ProShares\\' head of  investment strategy, Simeon Hyman, highlighted two anticipated uses  for the ETFs: diversification and tactical decision-making.  Hyman provides the example of an investor who already has high  exposure to a given sector—such as an executive compensated  in a company\\'s stock, or an inheritor who has received a large  number of shares—and does not want to take on excess  exposure.  \"Previously you\\'d have to maybe call up a trust company or find  someone to run a custom strategy for you to avoid that sector,  and here it\\'s just very straightforward: Buy an ETF. The sector\\'s  out, it\\'s redistributed across the other names on a  market-cap-weighted basis, you don\\'t have to worry about it,\"  Hyman said.   Second, the ETFs are designed for those who believe a given  sector, such as energy, is set to underperform the rest of the  market. \"If you have that conviction, this is a very  straightforward and easy way to effect that view,\" he said.

              "       'Banks worldwide may lose as much as $400 billion from subprime mortgages, as at least one in four of the risky home loans go into default, analysts said on Monday. Mike Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, estimated $150 billion to $250 billion of losses based on $1.2 trillion of U.S. subprime loans, and an additional $150 billion of losses on derivatives linked to subprime debt. David Hilder, a Bear Stearns analyst, also estimated a $150 billion to $250 billion loss on subprime home loans, in what he called a $2 trillion market. \"Given our fundamental outlook, which is for rising inflows of non-performing loans in both mortgage and commercial loan portfolios, we believe the odds are in favor of the write-downs getting worse, rather than better,\" this year, Hilder wrote. Banks including Citigroup,Merrill Lynch and Wachovia have announced more than $40 billion of write-offs this year as U.S. foreclosures set records and after investors stopped buying many kinds of risky debt. Mayo said large banks and brokerages may suffer $100 billion to $130 billion of the subprime losses. He said this could include $60 billion to $70 billion by year end, including $43 billion already reported. In the fourth quarter alone, he said Barclays, HSBC Holdings, Royal Bank of Scotland Group and UBS might each need to write off $5 billion, while Merrill Lynch might write off $4 billion and Bank of America Corp $1 billion. Mayo\\'s forecast assumes a 30 percent to 40 percent default rate and 40 percent to 50 percent loss rate.

              "       'The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has set up a financing package to fund the construction of a wind farm in Jordan, it announced Tuesday.   The package, of up to $80 million, will support the 51.75-megawatt (MW) Arbour Wind Farm in the south of the country. The facility is being built by the Abour Energy Company, a joint venture between Xenel International and AMEA Power.   A development institution that focuses on the private sector in emerging markets, the IFC is a sister organization of the World Bank and a member of the World Bank Group.   To date, it has invested over $300 million in Jordan to support clean energy. The financing package for the Arbour facility is made up of a $28 million loan for the IFC\\'s own account and mobilized parallel loans from the Islamic Development Bank.   \"Jordan\\'s energy sector has been on a steady path of reform,\" Mouayed Makhlouf, the IFC\\'s director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement Tuesday. \"Supporting renewable energy projects and opening the sector to private investments is a pillar of our work in Jordan and the region,\" Makhlouf added.   The IFC said it had structured the deal in the form of an Islamic finance Ijara transaction. According to the World Bank, an Ijara transaction involves a bank purchasing an asset on behalf of a client, and then allowing use of that asset for a fixed rental fee.   The Bank adds that ownership of the asset \"remains with the financier but may gradually transfer to the client who eventually becomes the owner.\"   The director general of Jordan\\'s National Electric Power Company, Amjad Rawashdeh, said in a statement Tuesday that its focus was on continuing to diversify energy sources. \"IFC\\'s work and investment has been crucial in helping the development of... renewables in the country,\" Rawashdeh added.   In April, GE Renewable Energy announced it would provide turbines for the development of a 100 MW wind farm in Jordan. The Mass Wind project is due to be operational by the end of 2019 and will meet the power needs of more than 150,000 homes.',\n",

Investors have been rattled by both the failed July 15 putsch,  when a group of rogue soldiers attempted to overthrow the  government, and the widespread crackdown that has followed, with  the arrests or dismissals of tens of thousands of people.    \"An unsuccessful coup attempt in July confirms heightened risks  to political stability,\" the Fitch statement said, saying a purge  of some 70,000 public sector workers \"generates uncertainty over  capacity and continuity.\"   \"Political uncertainty is expected to impact economic performance  and poses risks to economic policy,\" it added.    Both Fitch and Moody\\'s rate Turkey at the lowest investment-grade  rung, allowing its bonds to be bought by more conservative funds  that require a country to be classed as investment grade by at  least two agencies.    Moody\\'s said on July 18 it was putting Turkey\\'s credit rating on  review for a possible downgrade to junk status.   Standard & Poor\\'s cut its unsolicited rating on Turkey  further into junk territory last month and changed its outlook to  negative, also citing concerns following the coup.   In Friday\\'s statement, Fitch said the overwhelming public  opposition to the coup attempt and subsequent unity of most  political parties could lessen political fractures.   But security conditions have worsened, it said, referring to  militant attacks which it said were having a material impact on  the tourism sector.     It did not expect the fiscal stance to weaken in response to the  coup attempt, though \"the central bank and commercial banks are  facing renewed political pressure on interest rates,\" it  said.

              "       'Peloton shares climbed more than 9% Friday as investors realized the financial hit from the company\\'s treadmill recall isn\\'t as bad as some had feared.The exercise equipment maker said demand for its high-end cycles remains strong, despite people increasingly breaking free of stay-at-home routines and gyms seeing pandemic restrictions ease.Peloton is also still planning to launch in Australia later this year, and is ramping up marketing spending to try to reach new customers.\"While the recall will hit financials in the short term, and push back Tread financials a quarter or two, we think this was the prudent decision in the long term,\" Barclays analyst Mario Lu said in a note to clients. \"We continue to view Peloton as the leading company in connected digital fitness.\"When Peloton reported its fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday, it said fourth-quarter sales will be $165 million lower due to the recall. That puts fourth-quarter revenue at about $915 million, short of analysts\\' estimates for $1.12 billion, according to Refinitiv data.The projected $165 million impact consists of a roughly $105 million dent from a lack of treadmills sales during the period, since all sales are halted, Peloton said. The company is also assuming about 10% of current treadmill owners will ask for a refund for their machines, which cost $4,300 apiece, and that would lower sales by an additional $50 million.Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey had expected the recall to have a larger impact. She maintained her outperform rating on stock, but lowered her price target to $120 from $150, due to \"uncertainty around the ultimate financial impact of the recalls and on Peloton\\'s brand name.\"She noted, though, that demand for Peloton\\'s Bike and Bike+ machines is still solid. And the more expensive fix will be for Peloton\\'s Tread+ machine, rather than the less expensive Tread version, which represents a much smaller revenue stream overall, Telsey said.Peloton shares closed Thursday at $83.78. The stock is down about 45% year to date, bringing the company\\'s market cap to about $24 billion. Shares had tumbled nearly 15% on Wednesday, the day the company announced its voluntary recall, wiping $4.1 billion from Peloton\\'s market value.On a call, Chief Executive John Foley walked through the steps the company is taking with the U.S. Consumer Protection Safety Commission to launch the Tread in the United States later this year. It had been scheduled for May 27, but is being pushed back until Peloton and the CPSC can work on new safety protocols.That could potentially happen as early as July, Foley said.According to Telsey, that\\'s also earlier than many people were anticipating.\"Somewhat lost amidst the Tread/+ recalls discussion was a very strong third quarter,\" JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said. \"Peloton beat across all metrics.\"—CNBC\\'s Michael Bloom contributed to this reporting.',\n",

A loss of $2.64 a share was wider than an expected $1.94.The company blazed into its earnings in comeback mode, though. The stock had rallied 268% from its March low, hitting its highest level since 2017 on Thursday, even with the travel industry still struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic.But, that performance still pales in comparison to Airbnb. Since going public on Dec. 10, that stock has surged more than 200%. Airbnb\\'s market cap of $130 billion is larger than all the other online travel booking sites including Expedia, Booking and TripAdvisor.Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, broke down the Airbnb chart for CNBC\\'s \"Trading Nation\" on Thursday.\"It\\'s in an intermediate-term uptrend already just with history back to December, and with limited price history we don\\'t really have any ways to discern how overbought the stock is, but there are no real signs of upside exhaustion as we come into [Airbnb] earnings,\" she said.Airbnb is scheduled to report earnings on Feb. 25 for the first time as a publicly traded company. While Airbnb has benefited from a consumer preference for vacation rentals over hotel chains during the pandemic, it has still suffered from lockdowns – analysts surveyed by FactSet anticipate a net loss of $8.42 a share for its December-ended quarter.\"If you look at Expedia on the other hand, that uptrend still very much has positive momentum across time horizons and I\\'m not really one to fight that. But what I would say is that the risk reward is not great from a technical perspective,\" Stockton said.She highlights a band of support at $135 and resistance at $161, level with its 2017 high. The stock closed at $149.91 on Thursday.\"That creates a bad imbalance between the downside and upside potential here in terms of those levels so I don\\'t think it\\'s very compelling especially with the broader market showing some signs of short-term upside exhaustion,\" she said.',\n",

              "       'The economy is off to a rocky start in 2016. Investors and analysts are unhappy. But while many analysts focus on jittery stock markets and bad news from overseas, there is a disheartening trend right before our eyes that almost no one is paying attention to: The high-growth, young companies that have traditionally driven job growth and innovation in our country are a dying breed. For the past several decades, business start-ups have steadily declined in America.    Have people become less ambitious? Less innovative? That\\'s unlikely. A more probable explanation is that a steady accrual of rules and regulations for years has effectively eliminated a generation of entrepreneurs as the costs of running a new enterprise outweigh the benefits. The good news is that there is an antidote: increasing economic freedom.   But first, let\\'s look at the scope of the problem.  New and young businesses have historically been the heart of the U.S. economy. They are responsible for nearly all the new jobs we produce each year. And yet a growing body of research shows that young businesses have been on the decline in the U.S. since the 1980s, which means we have far fewer jobs available today than if businesses were still starting at the 1980s rate.   Even more alarming:  The share of high-growth young companies has collapsed, a new National Bureau of Economic Research study reports. The authors show that, historically, most job growth among young businesses has come from a small percentage of them that are growing much faster than all the others. Since 1999, this fast-growing cohort has essentially vanished, and young businesses are now more likely to be characterized as no-growth or slow-growth.  In other words, the dynamism most of us associate with the U.S. economy\\'s ability to create jobs and foster innovation through new enterprises is evaporating before our eyes.   Imagine if a steady stream of research showed an alarming spike in life-threatening diseases caused by additives in our food that had been weakening our immune systems. We would be doing everything we could as a society to understand and remove these debilitating additives from our food.  Despite a growing body of evidence that declining entrepreneurial dynamism is weakening our economy, policy makers have done little to understand the \"additives\" in our economy that are creating the problem. For help, they might start with the Fraser Institute\\'s annual Economic Freedom of North America report.  The latest report finds that states with more stringent labor laws, business start-up costs, licensing laws, and compliance costs — to name a few —  perform worse than more economically free states. Per capita income in the most free states is 14 percent higher than in the most un-free states.   Undaunted, however, regulators continue to pump harmful additives into our economy. Regulations implemented over the past seven years alone amount to a $100 billion tax on the economy. One estimate finds that 31 percent of regulations increase compliance costs without providing any real health or safety benefit.  The well-documented explosion in state licensing laws over the past generation has kept an untold number of entrepreneurs from entering the marketplace in the first place. It is no wonder that small business owners now rank regulations on par with taxes as the single biggest threat to their growth, more than the cost of health insurance or competition with big businesses.  Policy makers should pursue three courses of action to liberate would-be entrepreneurs from the tangled web of rules that hold them back. First, Congress should enact legislation requiring congressional approval of all federal regulations estimated to have an impact above a certain dollar amount, such as $100 million. Congress\\' bad habit of delegating rule-making authority to unelected officials in federal agencies is a big reason we have had an explosion in costly, complicated rules.  Second, Congress should enact a cap on the number and dollar amount of regulatory requirements every year. There are several ways to do this such as eliminating old regulations for each new, proposed regulation or capping the overall cost of regulations each year. Canada recently passed legislation capping their annual regulatory activity. The United States should do the same.  Third, state-level policy makers should provide alternatives to professional licensing, such as allowing individuals to opt out of licensing requirements in favor of nationally recognized, self-certification registries that rely on the tools of accountability and trust at the heart of the sharing economy. Too many professions have begun behaving like cartels behind the guise of licensing requirements. It is past time to break them up.  We hear a lot in our public discourse about inequality, but we hear far too little about our declining entrepreneurial dynamism. What if the latter is driving the former? It is certainly clear that starting a new business is not the path to upward mobility that it once was for middle class families.   The trend of declining business start-ups has worsened to the point that our children may never know the range of opportunity Americans, until recently, took for granted. It is time for our policy makers to follow the data and embrace economic freedom over the rules and regulations that are discouraging would-be entrepreneurs from getting in the game.

Biden announced the plan at a speech in Wilmington, Delaware. There, Biden drew a sharp contrast between his view of the national reckoning underway on racial justice and the ongoing protests in major cities, and the views of his opponent, President Donald Trump.\"Every instinct Trump has is to add fuel to the fire,\" said Biden. \"It\\'s the last thing we need. We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature. That\\'s how to restore peace in the streets.\"\\xa0Biden\\'s economic equity plan is largely a repackaging of dozens of his existing proposals from across the campaign\\'s platforms, such as his plan to offer a one-time student debt reduction of $10,000 per student and his call for a $15 hourly minimum wage.It also contains a separate section focused on criminal justice reform, which includes Biden\\'s plan to eliminate cash bail and to guarantee that formerly incarcerated people are provided temporary housing upon release from prison.\\xa0It will take all of these policies working together, he said, to begin to achieve economic equality for people of color.\"How do we break the cycle? In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back. This is about justice ... it\\'s also about jobs, good-paying jobs.

Created by Congress in 2000, the NMTC has supported more than 5,300 projects in the past two decades, but it is scheduled to expire at the end of this year.Unlike the previous three planks in Biden\\'s economic platform, the racial equity plan does not initially include demands for more federal spending. Instead, it is centered on the ways that funding Biden has already proposed in his first three planks is allocated.\\xa0Speaking to reporters Tuesday morning, senior Biden campaign advisors said more details about the costs and the funding of these proposals are forthcoming, although they did not specify when to expect the numbers.\\xa0One thing the plan does not contain is any reference to the word \"reparations,\" despite a growing movement on the left in recent years to quantify and compensate Black Americans for centuries of slave labor and for the subsequent Jim Crow laws that denied them access to the same opportunities to build wealth that White families were given.Grouping all of these policy proposals together under the umbrella of racial economic equity is one way for Biden\\'s campaign to codify the former vice president\\'s commitment to addressing the deep-seated racial injustice that has sparked massive civil unrest across the country this summer.\\xa0Biden said his plan is \"about rising to this moment of crisis.\\xa0Understanding people\\'s struggles, and building a future worthy of their courage and their ambition to overcome.\"Read the entire plan below.',\n",

              "       \"NEW YORK, Nov 12, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Fitch Ratings assigns an 'AA' rating\\nto the following New York Local Government Assistance Corporation (LGAC) bonds:\\n\\n--$202,550,000 series 2010B refunding bonds (subordinate lien).The bonds are being issued for refunding purposes.In addition, Fitch affirms the 'AA' rating on approximately $3.4 billion of\\noutstanding LGAC senior and subordinate lien bonds, including the underlying\\nrating on the series 2003A-4V bonds for which liquidity is being substituted and\\ninsurance removed.Fitch does not make a rating distinction between the senior and subordinate\\nliens due to the strong coverage and impoundment provisions.The Rating Outlook is Stable.RATING RATIONALE:\\n\\n--The designated source of payment, a portion of the state sales tax, is\\nbroad-based and provides generous coverage of debt service.--Although bond payments require annual legislative appropriation, there are\\nstrong protective provisions for insufficient funding and non-appropriation.Fitch believes that these features effectively eliminate the risk of\\nnon-appropriation.--The state's economy is broad, with substantial wealth and resources, although\\nthe health of the state's economy and finances is closely linked to the cyclical\\nfinancial services industry.--Strong financial planning and reporting practices, including quarterly\\nfinancial plan updates, allow the state to stay abreast of changing conditions.This credit strength is offset by the state's historical tendency to rely on\\nnonrecurring measures rather than sustainable budget solutions to address\\nrevenue weakening in downturns.--New York's debt burden is above average but still in the moderate range, and\\npensions are well funded.KEY RATING DRIVERS:\\n\\n--Changes in New York State's general obligation (GO) rating, to which this\\nrating is linked.--The state's GO rating will be driven by its continued ability to address\\nbudget shortfalls and protect its cash position.---Further driving the state's rating would be any meaningful change to the\\nshape of the financial services industry, which would have significant\\nimplications for the state's economy and finances.SECURITY:\\n\\nLGAC's bonds are general obligations of the corporation, payable, subject to\\nannual state legislative appropriation, from the yield of one cent of the\\nfour-cent state sales and use tax required by statute to be deposited in the\\nlocal government assistance tax fund.CREDIT SUMMARY:\\n\\nThe strength of the state's incentive to appropriate for the LGAC bonds results\\nin a rating equal to that assigned to New York's GO debt despite the\\nappropriation requirement for payment of debt service. In the event of\\nnon-appropriation, the state would be unable to receive revenues held by the\\nLGAC tax fund, which receives one cent of the state's sales tax and contributes\\nmore than $2 billion to the state general fund. Security strengths include the\\nbroad sales tax base, the consistently high level of coverage (about 6.3 times\\n(x) maximum annual debt service based on fiscal 2010 revenues), and the\\nstructural protections in place. Fitch does not make a rating distinction\\nbetween the senior and subordinate liens due to the strong impoundment\\nprovisions and coverage.LGAC was created in 1990 as a means of financing $4.7 billion of the state's\\naccrued general fund deficit, replacing the annual spring borrowing for local\\naid payments. The entire $4.7 billion authorization has been issued and\\nadditional debt can only be issued for refunding purposes.New York's 'AA' GO rating is based on the state's substantial wealth and\\nresources and broad economy, and also recognizes concerns regarding the outsized\\nrole that the financial services industry plays in the state's economy and\\nrevenue system. State net tax-supported debt levels have been relatively stable\\nas a percentage of personal income and are expected to remain above average but\\nstill in the moderate range. Pensions are well funded.The state's financial position has been strained. Revenue estimates for fiscal\\n2010, which ended on March 31, were revised downward repeatedly over the course\\nof the year, primarily reflecting reduced expectations for the personal income\\ntax. Despite gap-closing measures taken, fiscal 2010 ended with a deficit of\\n$1.65 billion that was carried over to fiscal 2011. The budget for fiscal 2011\\nwas not finalized until early August, more than four months into the fiscal\\nyear, although the debt service appropriation bill was passed before the start\\nof the fiscal year. A fiscal 2011 gap of about $9.2 billion including the\\ncarried-over fiscal 2010 deficit ($8.5 billion after factoring in budget\\nmeasures taken in December 2009) was addressed through spending control,\\nparticularly in the area of local aid, temporary and permanent revenue actions,\\nincluding a suspension of the sales tax exemption for clothing and a cigarette\\ntax increase to $4.35 per pack, and limited one-time measures. Deficit financing\\nwas not part of the gap-closing plan; however, the budget includes a substantial\\namount of federal stimulus funds. New York, which spends a larger than average\\namount on Medicaid, garners particular benefit from the increase in the federal\\nMedicaid matching percentage included in the federal stimulus package.In contrast to prior downturns, recovery is expected to be slow, and the state\\nis projected to confront significant outyear budget gaps as federal stimulus and\\ntemporary tax increase monies roll off. Earlier this month, the state reduced\\nits revenue forecast and increased expenditure expectations. The current fiscal\\nyear (which ends on March 31, 2011) is now reported to have a $315 million\\nshortfall to be addressed. The fiscal 2012 shortfall estimate has increased to\\n$9 billion from $8.2 billion, with the large gap reflecting the phase-out of\\nfederal stimulus monies. The gap forecast for fiscal 2013 is now $14.6 billion,\\nwith the expiration of both stimulus funds and the temporary personal income tax\\nrate increase. Fitch believes that downside risk to the forecast remains.With steep revenue declines, the state's cash position has been strained. The\\nstate has taken proactive measures to ensure cash adequacy, and continued focus\\non cash management measures will be necessary. The LGAC bonds are protected from\\nthe cash flow issues by the flow of funds.New York's employment decline in the recession was less severe than that of the\\nnation. Nonfarm employment did not start to fall, year-over-year, until November\\n2008 and was down 2.7% in 2009 compared to a 4.3% drop for the U.S. In September\\n2010, jobs in New York were flat to the prior year while national figures were\\nup 0.2% year-over-year. Unemployment remains below that of the nation in\\nSeptember 2010, at 8.3%, 86% of the U.S. level. Personal income performance has\\nbeen meaningfully weaker than that of the nation, down 3.1% in 2009, almost\\ndouble the national loss and the fourth worst of the states. The state's\\npersonal income per capita was the sixth highest among the states in 2009, at\\n117% of the U.S. average.New York's net tax-supported debt is above average but still in the moderate\\nrange at 5.6% of personal income. Most of New York's debt has been issued by\\nstate public authorities and secured by appropriations; only about 7% is GO.While this results in a diffuse debt structure, there is strong centralization\\nand oversight in the budget division, and approval by the public authorities\\ncontrol board is required for many of these bond issues.Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.In addition to the sources of information identified in the report\\n'Tax-Supported Rating Criteria', this action was additionally informed by\\ninformation from IHS Global Insight.Applicable Criteria and Related Research:\\n\\n--'Tax-Supported Rating Criteria', dated Aug. 16, 2010;\\n\\n--'U.S. State Government Tax-Supported Rating Criteria', dated Oct. 8, 2010.For information on Build America Bonds, visit 'www.fitchratings.com/BABs'.Applicable Criteria and Related Research:\\n\\nTax-Supported Rating Criteria\\n\\nhttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=548605\\n\\nU.S. State Government Tax-Supported Rating Criteria\\n\\nhttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=564546\\n\\nALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.PLEASE READ THESE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS BY FOLLOWING THIS LINK:\\nHTTP://FITCHRATINGS.COM/UNDERSTANDINGCREDITRATINGS.

              "       'At this hour, as crude oil futures are trading below $50 per barrel for the first time since May 2005, the U.S. House of Representatives is voting on a controversial bill that targets the oil industry with higher taxes, fees and royalties. The bill is expected to pass the House with ease. “Power Lunch” covered all the bases of the proposed legislation, hosting a debate between Sterling Burnett of the National Center for Policy Analysis and Karen Wayland of the Natural Resources Defense Council.Before we get into the debate – a few notes on the proposed bill: first: it would effectively prohibit oil companies from receiving an income tax deduction – one that was enacted in 2004 for the domestic manufacturing sector. It also requires Big Oil to renegotiate leases issued in error in 1998 and 1999 for drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico. If they refuse to renegotiate, they must instead pay a fee. The bill imposes another fee on all non-producing oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico.Also in the bill is $14-15 billion earmarked for the exploration and development of alternative energy. Burnett believes we should actually “put the brakes” on alternative energies like ethanol, corn and soy diesel because of the collateral damage it creates for the poor. He points to the doubling of the price of corn in the last year as an example of how this can hurt consumers – especially the lower class.',\n",

The homebuilder\\'s revenues fell 33 percent as home deliveries fell 20 percent and average prices declined 15 percent.

The acquisition allows Unilever to diversify its portfolio of consumer product brands, while the deal will help Sara Lee repurchase $1 billion in stock and \"invest for growth\" in core businesses.

Bears point out that we have moved over 50 percent since the March lows and are due for a correction, but Laszlo Birinyi (quoted in Morningstar) notes that there is little evidence for an imminent correction: \"Give me the evidence...in 1982 we went 424 days before we had a correction. In 2000, we went seven years before we had a 10% correction. In 2002, we went three or four years.\" 8) Short interest continues to decrease. Traders have bitterly complained that shorting the market has been a recipe for disaster in the past several months; many have told me they have been shorting much less. We continue to get evidence that shorting is indeed down. From August 31st to September 15th, the total amount of securities on the S&P 500 sold short dropped by 7.3 percent. __________________________________________________________Questions?\\xa0 Comments?\\xa0 tradertalk@cnbc.com',\n",

In his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday,  Bernanke said loose monetary policy was boosting  employment.    \"We believe the monetary policies we have conducted have helped  get stronger recovery and more jobs than we otherwise would have  had,\" he said, according to Reuters.    Bernanke forecast it would take three more years for unemployment  to decline to 6 percent, further diminishing concerns the Fed  might tighten policy sooner than expected. Previously, Bernanke  has said he will keep interest rates low until unemployment falls  to around 6.5 percent.    U.S. gains may be capped however by uncertainty about whether a  last-minute deal can be struck to avert the $85 billion of  spending cuts, known as the \"sequester\", due to hit on  Friday.    In his testimony, Bernanke warned Congress of the dangers of  failing to reach an agreement on how to combat  sequestration.    \"I think there is some cost to the economy of these repeated, I  won\\'t say \\'crises,\\' but these repeated episodes where Congress is  unable to come to some agreement and therefore some automatic  thing kicks in.

Should Anthem and Cigna eventually reach a deal to combine their  businesses, it will mark one of the most significant eras of  consolidation in the history of the health insurance  sector. Yet the question remains whether regulators will embrace  the deals as quickly as these rivals have embraced one another.  Four of the largest U.S. insurers will combine to form two health-care powerhouses, and the competition may spur more mergers among  smaller players. \"The effect is going to be very specific to markets,\" said  Christopher Koller, the president of the Milbank Memorial Fund, a  health policy research foundation that advises states.

Still, Koller argues that when it comes to insurance the bar has  been set fairly high by federal regulators.  \"I regulated a  market where a domestic, local, non-profit (Blue Cross plan) had  60-70 percent of market share.

The EMerge Alliance Occupied Space standard creates an integrated, open      platform for power, interior infrastructures, controls and a wide      variety of peripheral devices to facilitate the hybrid use of AC and DC      power within commercial buildings. Version 1.1 includes several      important updates to voltage limits, recommended cable sizes and other      requirements to assist companies developing products when using the      standard. These changes are backwards compatible and maximize the      interoperability and efficiency of EMerge Alliance Registered products.          According to Alliance Chairman Brian Patterson, the Occupied Space      standard version 1.1 allows for better connectivity with the forthcoming      EMerge Alliance Task Level/Furnishings standard and contributes to the      organization’s push to deliver a portfolio of integrated standards that      increase building flexibility and sustainability, while lowering      operating costs. These standards also facilitate the direct use of      on-site power generation and storage, which eliminates the need for many      inefficient power form conversions in buildings.          “The standards we’re creating for DC microgrids are the keys to      unlocking unprecedented efficiency, flexibility and sustainability in      buildings,” said Patterson. “The latest advancements in the EMerge      Alliance Occupied Space standard demonstrate that the Alliance is      committed to driving the continued development and expansion of      standards that will deliver DC power throughout buildings.”          The EMerge Alliance Occupied Space standard has been well received by      both product manufacturers and the early adopters of the building      community. There are more than 50 EMerge Alliance Registered products      available for use today, representing everything needed to implement the      platform. The EMerge Alliance Occupied Space standard version 1.1 is      available exclusively to Governing, Participating and General Members of      the Alliance, and a free public overview is available at http://www.emergealliance.org/Standard/RequestStandard.aspx.      To join the Alliance, please visit http://emergealliance.org/Join/HowtoJoin.aspx.     The EMerge Alliance’s Growing Standards Portfolio       The EMerge Alliance continues to work toward completing new DC power      standards to achieve net-zero energy buildings. The soon-to-be-released      Data/Telecom Center standard will provide a practical guide for the      hybrid use of DC power in data centers, offering better efficiency, a      smaller footprint, improved reliability and lower capital and      installation costs. Currently in development, the Campus Microgrid      standard will focus on establishing a standard for the integration of DC      microgrids throughout whole buildings. Also in progress, the Task      Level/Furnishings standard connects DC power to desktop technologies and      applications. Moving forward, the Alliance will continue its vision by      developing future standards for building services, such as HVAC, and      outdoor applications, such as electric vehicle charging. All EMerge      Alliance standards include consideration of power, infrastructure,      peripheral device and control applications required to operate a      building application platform using DC power.     About the EMerge Alliance       The EMerge Alliance is an open industry association leading the rapid      adoption of safe DC power distribution in commercial buildings through      the development of EMerge Alliance standards. These innovative standards      integrate interior infrastructures, power, controls and devices in      common microgrid platforms to facilitate the hybrid use of AC and DC      power throughout buildings for unprecedented design and space      flexibility, greater energy efficiency and improved sustainability.

But according to Ari Wald, head of technical analysis, only  certain types of financial companies are worth buying. That is  why he\\'s not keen on the ETF that tracks the financial sector as  a whole (trading under the ticker symbol XLF).  \"I like financials selectively, but I don\\'t think the XLF is the  best way to play it,\" Wald said.  Though the XLF broke above a key resistance level last week and  made new highs, Wald believes there are some signals the recent  rally is not all in the sector as a whole.   (Read: )  \"Only a net 17 stocks of the 84 that are in the sector made a new  52-week high with it,\" Waldsaid. \"So it\\'s a very selective move,  not broadlybased. A little bit of a closer look will show that  the capital markets industry and the REITs industry were the big  drivers of this trend. These are the industries that we want to  buy.\"  Wald, however, is worried about the banks. \"I think XLF has too  much exposure to the banks,\" he said. \"I would rather be a little  more selective and concentrate on the industries rather than the  sector.\"  Gina Sanchez, founder of Chantico Global, is on the same page as  Wald when it comes to the XLF\\'s exposure to banks.  (Read: Citigroup facing restrictions  on sales of hedge fund investments: Report)  Banks make up about 36 percent of the XLF\\'s holdings. \"That\\'s a  huge driver of how it will do,\" said Sanchez, a CNBC contributor.  \"To the extent that we don\\'t have a constructive view on banks,  it\\'s hard to get really excited about the XLF.\"  Though banks have had good earnings results in the second quarter  of 2014, Sanchez thinks that already has been priced into the  stocks.  \"Performance has really been bid up over the last several  months,\" Sanchez said. \"At this point you\\'re looking for even  more performance than they\\'ve already given, and I\\'m not sure  that\\'s possible. So if you have a bad view on banks, you probably  don\\'t have a great view on XLF.\" To see the full discussion on the XLF, with Wald on the  technicals and Sanchez on the fundamentals, watch the above  video.  -----  Follow us on Twitter: @CNBCNumbers  Like us on Facebook: facebook.com/CNBCNumbers',\n",

This is the      first public grouper of medical condition episodes-of-care.      CaveGrouper-Lite™ builds longitudinal episodes of care for acute      conditions (e.g., upper respiratory infections, sinusitis) and for      chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, asthma).          The Cave Grouper™ is the oldest and most established grouper of      episodes-of-care in the market today. The first article was published in      1992 based on work formed since 1989. Over the past 22 years,      derivations of the Cave Grouper™ have been applied and validated using a      wide variety of study populations totaling over 90 million individuals      and 705,000 physicians. CCGroup has invested significant time and effort      to determine and develop the most appropriate methods to build      episodes-of-care and to obtain reliable, stable provider efficiency      scores, especially the method on using a predefined set of medical      conditions for a specialty type.     “CCGroup is proud to be the first company to release a free      grouper of medical condition episodes to the public,” stated Dr.      Douglas G. Cave, President of CCGroup. “This is a key phase to allow      all of CCGroup’s methods and algorithms to be 100% transparent for      public use – including health plans, health systems, and the Federal and      State governments.”          CaveGrouper-Lite™ has been successfully downloaded a significant number      of times – and the downloads continue. Dr.      John Rootenberg, SVP of Clinical Strategy, affirmed the following      percentage breakdown by entity type. “20% of downloads were from health      plans; 16% from healthcare consulting firms; 15% from physician groups;      14% from hospital-based health systems; 14% from academic universities      and research organizations; 9% from healthcare software vendors; 4% for      State and Federal Government agencies (such as the Centers for Medicare      and Medicaid Services); 4% from pharmaceutical/biotech companies; 2%      from potential competitors to CCGroup; and 2% from all other.”          A main reason stated for downloading CaveGrouper-Lite™ continues to be      the new Accountable Care Organization (ACO) and Patient      Centered Medical Home (PCMH) legislation. “The      CaveGrouper-Lite™ is essential for consistent episode-of-care analytics      and performance measurement,” stated Dr. Cave. “For resource      planning purposes, clinical leaders need to gain a complete view of the      medical condition prevalence of their covered population base. In this      manner, healthcare resource needs may be adjusted with changes in the      condition-specific prevalence rates.”          Other common reasons stated for downloading CaveGrouper-Lite™ included      the following. Clinical leaders stated they need to track medical      condition episodes-of-care to physicians and compare their average costs      and utilization patterns to one another and to CCGroup’s national      comparative database. Also, under the CMS Bundled Payments initiative,      the episodes-of-care may be used by clinical leaders to examine possible      bundled payment models.          Dr. Cave stated, “A key foundation for accountable performance      measurement is the CaveGrouper-Lite™ because the methods and algorithms      are 100% transparent, free to the public, and tested and validated on      all study populations.”     Download      the CaveGrouper-Lite™  About Cave Consulting Group, Inc.

(WellPoint) (Indianapolis, IN) [NYSE: WLP]. The rating has been      placed under review with negative implications, which is consistent with      the under review status of the existing ratings of WellPoint and its      insurance subsidiaries. (See A.M. Best’s press release dated July 10,      2012 for further information.)          The securities are being sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant      to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. If the initial purchasers      exercise their over-allotment option in full, the net proceeds from the      offering would approach $1.5 billion. WellPoint intends to use up to      $400 million of the net proceeds for common share repurchase and the      remainder for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to      additional share repurchase and debt repayment.          Although WellPoint’s pro forma financial leverage—as well as its      goodwill and intangibles to equity ratio—is somewhat higher than      similarly-rated peers, A.M. Best views somewhat favorably the financial      flexibility afforded by the convertible debentures. Additionally, the      issuance is consistent with A.M. Best’s expectations with respect to      WellPoint’s capital structure incorporating the financing for the      previously announced $5.0 billion (approximate) acquisition of AMERIGROUP      Corporation (Amerigroup).          The Amerigroup acquisition is expected to close by year-end 2012,      subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. WellPoint’s ratings      are anticipated to remain under review pending the completion of the      transaction and A.M. Best’s continuing discussions with management.      However, A.M. Best will continue to monitor WellPoint’s operating      performance, risk-based capitalization at the operating companies and      its capital structure to ensure financial and operating metrics remain      within A.M. Best’s expectations.          The methodology used in determining these ratings is Best’s Credit      Rating Methodology, which provides a comprehensive explanation of A.M.

              "       'SpaceX Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk flew to the Seattle area in June for meetings with engineers leading a satellite launch project crucial to his space company\\'s growth.Within hours of landing, Musk had fired at least seven members of the program\\'s senior management team at the Redmond, Washington, office, the culmination of disagreements over the pace at which the team was developing and testing its Starlink satellites, according to the two SpaceX employees with direct knowledge of the situation.Known for pushing aggressive deadlines, Musk quickly brought in new managers from SpaceX headquarters in California to replace a number of the managers he fired. Their mandate: Launch SpaceX\\'s first batch of U.S.-made satellites by the middle of next year, the sources said.The management shakeup and the launch timeline, previously unreported, illustrate how quickly Musk wants to bring online SpaceX\\'s Starlink program, which is competing with OneWeb and Canada\\'s Telesat to be first to market with a new satellite-based Internet service.Those services - essentially a constellation of satellites that will bring high-speed Internet to rural and suburban locations globally - are key to generating the cash that privately-held SpaceX needs to fund Musk\\'s real dream of developing a new rocket capable of flying paying customers to the moon and eventually trying to colonize Mars.\"It would be like rebuilding the Internet in space,\" Musk told an audience in 2015 when he unveiled Starlink. \"The goal would be to have a majority of long-distance Internet traffic go over this network.\"But the program is struggling to hire and retain staff, the employees said. Currently, about 300 SpaceX employees work on Starlink in Redmond, the sources said. According to GeekWire, Musk said in 2015 the Redmond operation would have \"probably several hundred people, maybe a thousand people\" after 3-4 years in operation.So far this year, about 50 employees left the company \"on their own accord,\" one of the SpaceX employees said, though the reason for those departures was unclear. Overall, SpaceX employs more than 6,000 staff.As of Tuesday, there were 22 job openings — including a job making espresso drinks — for the Redmond office, according to SpaceX\\'s website.SpaceX spokeswoman Eva Behrend told Reuters the Redmond office remains an essential part of the company\\'s efforts to build a next-generation satellite network.\"Given the success of our recent Starlink demonstration satellites, we have incorporated lessons learned and re-organized to allow for the next design iteration to be flown in short order,\" Behrend said.She had no further comment on the reorganization or the launch window, but noted the strategy was similar to the rapid iteration in design and testing which led to the success of its rockets.Among the managers fired from the Redmond office was SpaceX Vice President of Satellites Rajeev Badyal, an engineering and hardware veteran of Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, and top designer Mark Krebs, who worked in Google\\'s satellite and aircraft division, the employees said. Krebs declined to comment, and Badyal did not respond to requests for comment.The management shakeup followed in-fighting over pressure from Musk to speed up satellite testing schedules, one of the sources said. SpaceX\\'s Behrend offered no comment on the matter.Culture was also a challenge for recent hires, a second source said.

A third court, meanwhile, rejected an effort to stay the rule\\'s implementation.\"Three courts have now carefully considered the full range of industry attacks on the DOL\\'s best interest fiduciary rule, and they have firmly rejected all of them,\" said Stephen Hall, the legal director of Better Markets, a non-profit group that supports the rule.\"The decision issued today is definitive and sends a message that ought to put a stake through the heart of industry\\'s efforts to destroy this common-sense rule.\"The Labor Department\\'s \"fiduciary\" rule requires brokers to put their clients\\' best interests first when advising them about individual retirement accounts or 401(k) retirement plans.It is championed by consumer advocates and retirement non-profit groups, but has been staunchly opposed by the financial services sector, which argues it will make retirement advice too costly and harm lower-income retirees in particular.The long list of groups that sued the Labor Department in the Dallas federal court include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Financial Services Institute, the Financial Services Roundtable, the Insured Retirement Institute and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.In a joint statement, those groups said they disagreed with the judge\\'s ruling and vowed to \"pursue all of our available options to see that this rule is rescinded.\"The decision in the Labor Department\\'s favor came just a few hours after the Justice Department had petitioned the court to stay issuing a ruling because of the Feb. 3 White House request to review the rule to determine if it should be revised or scrapped.Lynn, who was appointed to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, denied that request shortly after her ruling was filed.\"The Department of Labor is continuing to follow the president\\'s memorandum and is exploring options to delay the applicability date,\" Labor Department spokeswoman Jillian Rogers said in a statement.Sweeping legal arguments rejectedWednesday\\'s ruling represents a setback for Gibson Dunn & Crutcher attorney Eugene Scalia, who represented the business groups and has a strong track record for winning legal challenges to kill off unwanted Wall Street regulations.The decision addressed a sweeping series of legal arguments that Gibson Dunn\\'s attorneys made against the rule, including claims that the Labor Department had exceeded its legal authority and that it had violated federal rulemaking procedures by failing to conduct an adequate cost-benefit analysis to help justify the regulation.\"The court finds the DOL adequately weighed the monetary and non-monetary costs on the industry of complying with the rules, against the benefits to consumers,\" Lynn wrote.\"In doing so, the DOL conducted a reasonable cost-benefit analysis.\"Lynn also rejected other arguments, including claims that the rule violated free speech rights of brokers and that the rule violated federal laws governing arbitration.The case could still be appealed to a higher court.Meanwhile, there are still several other pending legal challenges to the rule.',\n",
              "       'The news cycle has been largely dominated by Republican presidential nominee  Donald Trump\\'s assertion that the election process is rigged against him.     Trump has repeatedly made this claim since mid-summer, and it was an important topic at the last presidential debate.  But will this help his public standing or create ill-will?  I\\'ve studied and written about excuses and blame, and we know a fair amount about when excuses work and when they will likely backfire.    Making excuses is part of human nature.  People tend to care deeply about what others think of them, and excuses are a way of managing others\\' opinions.     The \"rigged election\" claim is a particular type of excuse called self-handicapping.  Excuses are generally offered after a problem occurs.  In contrast, self-handicaps are excuses offered before an event.  The idea is that by shaping expectations, one will be held less accountable in the event that things go poorly.   An example is a student telling her mother \"Hey, don\\'t expect me to do well on the test today.  The teacher is terrible, he hasn\\'t done a good job explaining the material.\"  If the student does poorly on the test, she has deflected blame away from herself and on the teacher and hopefully mom won\\'t be as angry because of the pre-emptive strike.       There is another potential benefit to self-handicapping.  If one offers a self-handicap and succeeds in spite of the impediment, heroes are born.  Think of the famous Michael Jordan flu game in the 1997 NBA finals.  Everybody knew that Jordan was very ill and that the chances of a typical Jordan performance were slim because of his health.  If he had a bad game, nobody would have changed their opinion of him because after all, he was really sick.  But Jordan overcame his illness and had one of his most memorable games, scoring 38 points and cementing his legend.   Donald Trump\\'s rigged-election claim is classic self-handicapping. However, it\\'s important to note that successfully self-handicapping hinges on credibility and believability.    People will evaluate the sincerity of the person delivering the excuse and the plausibility of the excuse itself. People are uncomfortable when they believe that someone is trying to manipulate them. And, if someone has a pattern of making excuses rather than accepting responsibility, it is more difficult to believe the most recent explanation.     Think back to Trump\\'s explanations for his performance in the earlier debates.  He blamed his performance at the Sept. 26 debate in part on a bad microphone that was not noticed by anyone other than the candidate.  The Oct. 9 debate included several complaints about biased moderators, including remarking that it was one on three.     The credibility of the messenger and the message, based in part on the frequency of the rigged-election claim and past excuses, should be concerns for the Trump camp in predicting public reaction to the rigged-election claims.            Many have grown weary of the tone of the campaign rhetoric, which will affect how voters interpret future remarks from both major-party candidates.  Trump\\'s core followers will no doubt accept the rigged election claim as gospel, believing that if he loses, it is because of an unfair process and therefore not Trump\\'s fault.  And if he wins, then he is a hero for overcoming the bias.     However, issues with the credibility and frequency of the claims, along with what some may interpret as their self-serving nature, will likely backfire with many voters.  It doesn\\'t appear that these remarks are designed to spur a change in the election process as much as to protect future reputation.  Self-handicapping can be an effective impression-management strategy, but may also have unintended repercussions.    The rigged-election claim was intended to diminish personal blame if he loses the election.  Instead, he likely will alienate more voters because they don\\'t like being manipulated.

A spokesperson for the network was quoted as saying, \"We fear that access to traditional forms of financing will be full of red tape, considering that banks today are already highly risk averse. The additional uncertainty brought on by the disaster, whether businesses were directly affected by it or not could very well lead to fewer loans and lines of credit. We feel it more necessary than ever to spread the message that alternatives like merchant cash advances, cash flow loans, and other forms of merchant financing are accessible.\"A merchant cash advance allows businesses to tap into their projected future revenues today by literally selling a fixed portion of those future sales to a factoring company.Cash flow loans allow businesses to leverage their historical revenues and positive cash flow to get approved for a short-term business loan. Accepting credit cards as a form of payment is not necessary for consideration.Approval and funding is typically completed in less than a week. Applicants operating an existing business in a Hurricane affected area can request an even further expedited application process by checking the designated box on the website\\'s inquiry forms.MerchantCashAdvanceIndustry.org makes no guarantee of loan approval, is not offering grants, and is not involved in any type of governmental assistance program. We are not a lender. Our partners are responsible for all financing terms and decisions.

Tulsi Gabbard sued former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday for allegedly defaming her by suggesting the Hawaii congresswoman is a \"Russian asset.\"\"Clinton\\'s false assertions were made in a deliberate attempt to derail Tulsi\\'s campaign,\" said the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.The suit claims that Gabbard has suffered \"actual damages\" of \"$50 million — and counting\" from Clinton\\'s comments. But the suit does not cite a specific amount of damages it is seeking.Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee who previously was a senator from New York, said in an October interview that an unnamed Democratic presidential candidate was \"the favorite of the Russians.\"Clinton did not mention Gabbard, a four-term congresswoman, by name in that interview with the podcast \"Campaign HQ With David Plouffe.\"But Clinton\\'s spokesman, Nick Merrill, said after the interview that \"If the nesting doll fits,\" when asked if she had been referring to Gabbard, who is also a major in the Army National Guard and a combat veteran of Iraq.Merrill later said in a tweet that Clinton was referring to the Republican Party grooming Gabbard. But it is Russians, not the GOP, who are known for making nesting, or Matryoshka dolls.Clinton, wife of President Bill Clinton, lost the 2016 election to Republican nominee Donald Trump.The report by special counsel Robert Mueller as well as a probe by the Senate Intelligence Committee have both found that Russian agents tried to damage Clinton\\'s candidacy, and that they tried to promote the third-party candidacy of Green Party nominee Jill Stein in order to harm Clinton\\'s chances of winning the White House.',\n",
              "       'The market for cloud-computing infrastructure to power applications has grown immensely since Amazon introduced its first cloud services in 2006, but U.S. investors haven\\'t had a great way of investing exclusively in cloud. That will change in the coming weeks when a company called DigitalOcean starts trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"DOCN.\"Buying shares of Amazon -- or Alibaba, Google, IBM, Microsoft or Oracle -- has meant getting a small percentage of exposure to the public cloud. DigitalOcean is different because it doesn\\'t do anything else.The company will start out with a much lower valuation than those other companies. In a Monday update to the prospectus for its initial public offering, DigitalOcean said it expects to sell shares at $44 to $47 per share, which would give it a market cap of about $4.8 billion at the middle of the range. DigitalOcean also said Tiger Global and an entity tied to existing investor Access Industries want to buy up to $175 million in the company\\'s shares at the time of the IPO.Unlike public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services, DigitalOcean is not profitable. It lost almost $44 million in 2020, compared with a $40 million loss in 2019. DigitalOcean is also growing more slowly than AWS, despite that AWS generates 142 times more revenue. AWS revenue in 2020 totaled $45.37 billion, up 29.5%, while DigitalOcean reported 25% revenue growth.That might be okay, because DigitalOcean has a specialty: Simplicity. It isn\\'t overwhelming to new users, who wind up increasing the amount they spend on DigitalOcean services over time.Simplicity is one of the four principles the founders picked when DigitalOcean started in 2012. \"We take infrastructure technology and make it simple across all aspects of the product experience,\" CEO Yancey Spruill, a former operating chief and finance chief at SendGrid, wrote in a letter to investors in the prospectus.',\n",

              "       'President Donald Trump\\'s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was paid $500,000 for work he did for a company co-founded by the Ukrainian-American businessman arrested last week on campaign finance charges, Giuliani told Reuters on Monday.The businessman, Lev Parnas, is a close associate of Giuliani and was involved in his effort to investigate Trump\\'s political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, who is a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination.Giuliani said Parnas\\' company, Boca Raton, Florida-based Fraud Guarantee, whose website says it aims to help clients \"reduce and mitigate fraud,\" engaged Giuliani Partners, a management and security consulting firm, around August 2018. Giuliani said he was hired to consult on Fraud Guarantee\\'s technologies and provide legal advice on regulatory issues.Federal prosecutors are \"examining Giuliani\\'s interactions\" with Parnas and another Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, who was also indicted on campaign finance charges, a law enforcement source told Reuters on Sunday.The New York Times reported last week that Parnas had told associates he paid Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for what Giuliani said was business and legal advice. Giuliani said for the first time on Monday that the total amount was $500,000.Giuliani told Reuters the money came in two payments made within weeks of each other. He said he could not recall the dates of the payments. He said most of the work he did for Fraud Guarantee was completed in 2018 but that he had been doing follow-up for over a year.Parnas and Fruman were arrested at Dulles Airport outside Washington last week on charges they funneled foreign money to unnamed U.S. politicians in a bid to influence U.S.-Ukraine relations in violation of U.S. campaign finance laws. The men were preparing to board a plane to Europe.According to an indictment unsealed by U.S. prosecutors, an unidentified Russian businessman arranged for two $500,000 wires to be sent from foreign bank accounts to a U.S. account controlled by Fruman in September and October 2018. The money was used, in part, by Fruman, Parnas and two other men charged in the indictment to gain influence with U.S. politicians and candidates, the indictment said.Foreign nationals are prohibited from making contributions and other expenditures in connection with U.S. elections, and from making contributions in someone else\\'s name.Giuliani said he was confident that the money he received was from \"a domestic source,\" but he would not say where it came from.\"I know beyond any doubt the source of the money is not any questionable source,\" he told Reuters in an interview. \"The money did not come from foreigners. I can rule that out 100%,\" he said.He declined to say whether the money had been paid directly to him by Fraud Guarantee or from another source.John Dowd, a lawyer for Parnas and Fruman, also would not discuss the source of the funding that Giuliani said he received for his work for Fraud Guarantee. \"What I know is privileged,\" Dowd said.',\n",

(Tweet This)  \"There\\'s nervousness among momentum investors caused by some of  the outperforming names either missing or giving cautious  comments in earnings reports,\" said Robert Pavlik, chief market  strategist at Boston Private Wealth.   \"I don\\'t think much of it is warranted,\" he said, noting some  profit-taking.   The major averages came off session lows in the close. The Dow  Jones industrial average ended at its lowest level in 6 months  and posted its first 6-day losing streak since October.  Stocks extended losses in midday trade as the S&P 500 broke  through a key level of 2,087 that many analysts were watching.  The index closed below that level but held above its 200-day  moving average of 2,072.   Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said the next  level of support is 2,063 to 2,067.   Viacom and 21st Century Fox plunged, joining Disney in a  post-earnings stock decline to bring the media sector down about  8 percent for the week so far. At its lows the media sector was  off about 11 percent for the week, on track for its worst week since October  2008, when it lost 21.87 percent.   The media sector weighed on consumer discretionary, off more than  1 percent as one of the greatest decliners in the S&P  500.  Read MoreAmid media carnage,  opportunities may abound  Health care was the worst sector performer, falling more than 2  percent as biotechs plunged. The declines weighed heavily on the  Nasdaq, which closed more than 1.5 percent lower.  The iShares Nasdaq  biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 4.3 percent,  while Apple reversed recent declines to end mildly  higher.   The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 120 points lower,  after falling as much as 177 points.   The greatest weight on the index was Disney, which closed 1.8 percent lower,  off an earlier 5.5 percent decline. The stock extended its  post-earnings plunge from Wednesday after the firm missed on  revenue and disappointed investors with subscriber losses.  Year-to-date, the stock is the third-best performer in the Dow.  \"You\\'ve got some nervousness ahead of the jobs report, lack of a  bullish impetus, narrowing leadership,\" said Adam Sarhan, CEO of  Sarhan Capital. \"The market continues to get weaker, not  stronger.\"   He is watching 2,040 on the S&P 500. \"Right now there\\'re less  and less bullish drivers and concurrently more bearish drivers,\"  Sarhan said. \"If support breaks there\\'s no question on my mind  (that we get a correction).\"   \"Market participants are really groping for a new catalyst to  move stocks higher,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment  strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"There\\'s still some  questions on the economy, the pace of growth.\"   He noted there were few indications that the market was strongly  concerned about an interest rate hike, as bond yields held lower,  the dollar was flat, and gold traded a touch higher.   \"The rise in the Treasury market is a take of two separate things  moving in different directions,\" said Eric Stein, co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance Management. He noted hawkish comments from policymakers balanced by \"the continued selloff in commodity prices.\" \"It\\'s not all about September, it\\'s obviously about the path of rates (in the next) two to three years,\" Stein said. Friday\\'s jobs report is one of the few key pieces of data expected before the Federal Reserve meets in September and could potentially find enough impetus for raising short-term interest rates. Economists expect 223,000 nonfarm payrolls on Friday, with  unemployment unchanged at 5.3 percent, according to Thomson  Reuters.  \"I think this (jobs) report is what everyone\\'s keying on. We\\'ve  kind of got mixed messages in the data this week,\" said Chris  Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets.   \"I think the key is average hourly earnings and if that comes  with a 2 percent increase tomorrow, absolutely September comes  into play,\" Gaffney said.  Read MoreEarnings? Who cares.  All eyes are on Jobs Friday  \"I think the market is really getting anxious about nonfarm  payrolls,\" said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya  Investment Management. \"If it\\'s a moderate number, then (liftoff)  could be put off, but if it\\'s a really big number  tomorrow—if unemployment is 5.2 percent—the market  struggles a little bit, raise the prospect of a September rate  increase.\"  Jobs data so far this week was mixed. Initial claims came in Thursday  at 270,000, slightly below expectations. The private sector  report from ADP showed fewer-than-expected jobs were created. U.S. job cuts in July  exceeded 100,000 for the first time in nearly four years as the  military announced plans to reduce troop and civilian  workforce payrolls, according to Challenger, Gray &  Christmas. A year ago, U.S. companies announced plans to cut  46,887 jobs.  However, the major jump in job cuts is not expected to  significantly affect Friday\\'s key report.  \"We think this increase in announced job cuts will have no impact  on the July BLS report, and only a minimal impact on the  employment data over the next few years. The jump in layoffs  announced in July was basically entirely due to reductions  announced by the US Army that are scheduled to begin in October  and be implemented over the next two years,\" JPMorgan said in a  morning note.',\n",

The question nobody seems to be asking the Fed, according to Grasso: \"How are you going to do  that in the context of everyone else in the world stimulating  [and] lowering rates—applying, if you will, the type of  stimulus we applied.\"  The total assets of the Fed have increased  from about $869 billion in August 2007, during three rounds of  quantitative easing bond purchases  that started in November 2008 in an effort to support the economy  and combat the effects of the financial crisis.

              "       'HARTFORD, Conn. -- Connecticut\\'s athletic director says the university is looking for a sponsor to step forward and secure the naming rights for its planned basketball training center and has no plans to name the building after newly retired basketball coach Jim Calhoun.\"There\\'s not been one point in the conversation about naming the building for Jim, because we\\'ve always, since I got here, been talking about the naming opportunity to raise money,\" said Ward Manuel, who addressed the speculation Monday after Calhoun spoke at a chamber of commerce breakfast in Cromwell.The facility, which is expected to cost more than $40 million, is being funded entirely by private donations.It would be built adjacent to Gampel Pavilion on the site where the former football stadium was razed earlier this year. Plans call for separate practice courts for the men\\'s and women\\'s basketball teams, locker rooms, weight rooms, classrooms, a sports medicine center and offices for the basketball staff.About $22 million of the $32 million needed to break ground on the center, the school said this week.\"We\\'re more than halfway toward the total and about 75 percent to what we need to start construction,\" Manuel said.Calhoun, who retired as coach last month, is raising money for the center as part of his new job as a special assistant to Manuel.He said he will be visiting NBA training camps this fall and plans to ask former UConn players for their help with the center, which he said will also celebrate the history of Husky basketball.\"Some of the kids have expressed some interest, and those who haven\\'t are going to become more interested,\" Calhoun said.Calhoun said he\\'s talked to planners about including a locker room just for basketball alumni, who will be able to use the facility.\"That in turn, in my opinion, will keep, five years, 10 years, 20, down the line, all those guys connected,\" he said. \"And as guys graduate and go on to their careers, obviously they will be able to do more. _ maybe one guy will want a room named after him, etcetera.\"Earlier this summer, the school announced that Webster Bank had made a significant donation to the building, but would not release the details. Last December, the school announced that a Woodbridge couple, Peter J. and Pamela H. Werth donated $4.5 million for the building, the largest single private gift ever to the Division of Athletics.',\n",
              "       'Uber could still make a U-turn.That\\'s according to JC O\\'Hara, chief market technician at MKM Partners, who told CNBC\\'s \"Trading Nation\" on Friday that breaching one key level could greatly bolster the stock\\'s bull case.Uber shares have endured a great deal of push-and-pull in recent days, sent higher on Friday by positive analyst notes from Stifel and SunTrust, but tipped into a 1% decline on Monday after the city of London stripped the ride-hailing giant of its license to operate there — Uber\\'s biggest European market. The order is on hold as Uber appeals the decision.Looking at Uber\\'s chart since its IPO — which, as of Monday, displayed a painful 36% decline from the debut price — O\\'Hara saw some hope for the stock.\"I can really appreciate this recent short-term positive momentum, especially after we got past the lockup expiration earlier this month,\" O\\'Hara said. Since the\\xa0\\xa0on\\xa0Nov. 6, current and former insiders including ex-CEO Travis Kalanick,have sold large blocks of shares. \"But ... if we take a step back and look at the six-month chart, we find that we are still in a defined downtrend,\" O\\'Hara said. \"We have price trading below a declining 50-day moving average. We have a series of lower highs in place as well as lower lows. So, I think it might be too premature to say the worst is behind us.\"Still, O\\'Hara said one level would determine Uber\\'s ability to turn around.\"If we do manage to push up and break above the October highs in that $34-35 area, I think I would be a little bit more confident at that point in time that the worst is behind us, and the base suggests that we can move higher at that point,\" the technical analyst said.Uber shares were just above the $29 level in early Monday trading.Steve Chiavarone, equity strategist, vice president and portfolio manager at Federated, wasn\\'t as confident that Uber could find an upward catalyst.\"I think scalability is the issue,\" Chiavarone said in Friday\\'s segment. \"We focus on incremental margins. You\\'ve got insurance costs here that grow as the company expands, and that raises questions about scalability. So, as we evaluate IPOs, particularly through our Kaufmann Growth franchise, what we\\'re looking for is companies that are asset-light, can scale the business and are generating incremental margins. I\\'m not sure we find that here.\"Chiavarone added that his firm was not yet exposed to the ride-hailing space, citing its stringent guidelines for investing in newly public names.\"What we\\'re looking for are those companies where we can see a clear pathway to cash-flow growth because that ultimately is going to be where the value is, and so we have not played this space,\" he said.Earlier this year, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC that he expected the company to be profitable by 2021.Disclaimer',\n",
              "       'Consumer prices in the world\\'s second-largest economy accelerated  to a six-month high in February as seasonal distortions caused  food prices to spike.  Consumer price inflation rose 2.3 percent from a year ago, faster  than January\\'s 1.8 percent rise and well above Reuters  expectations for 1.9 percent rise. February\\'s expansion was the  fastest annual pace of growth since July 2014, Reuters said.  February\\'s spike was only a temporary effect, warned Grace Ng, greater China economist at J.P Morgan.  \"Part of the increase is due to Chinese New Year-related issues.  Generally, the inflation picture overall is quite tame. For the  whole year, we\\'re still looking for inflation below 2 percent,\"  she told CNBC\\'s \"Squawk Box.\"  The week-long Lunar New Year holiday that began on February 7  tends to increase demand for fresh food every year, which pushes up prices.

Richard Burr of North Carolina, said in a statement.\"Frozen by \\'paralysis of analysis,\\' hamstrung by constraints both real and perceived, Obama officials debated courses of action without truly taking one,\" he said.Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the committee\\'s top Democrat, said that there were \"many flaws\" with the Obama administration\\'s response but noted that \"many of those were due to problems with our own system – problems that can and should be corrected.\"The report was released one day after President Donald Trump was acquitted by the Senate of a charge that he abused his power by seeking to pressure the government of Ukraine to open investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden. He was also acquitted of a charge of obstruction of Congress. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.Trump, who spent the first two years of his presidency dogged by a federal investigation into whether he unlawfully conspired with the Russian government in the 2016 election, has criticized Obama for his handling of the situation.\"He did NOTHING, and had no intention of doing anything!\" Trump wrote in a post on Twitter last year.The U.S. intelligence community concluded in 2017 that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign during the 2016 campaign targeting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and that the Russian government had a \"clear preference\" for Trump.The attacks included the pilfering of data and emails from Democratic National Committee networks which were then released to outlets including WikiLeaks, an anti-secrecy group, in a manner designed to raise doubts about Clinton\\'s viability.The Senate Intelligence Committee also concluded that the Russian government sought to bolster Trump\\'s 2016 election chances.Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who led the investigation into Trump\\'s campaign, concluded that Trump expected to benefit from Russian interference. Mueller, however, did not establish coordination between Trump\\'s associates and the Russian disinformation campaign.Trump tweetThe Senate report released Thursday is the third, out of an expected five, stemming from the committee\\'s probe into the government\\'s handling of Russian meddling efforts. The investigation began in 2017 and has proceeded on a largely bipartisan basis, in contrast with parallel congressional inquiries.',\n",

The Norwegian crown was the biggest loser, falling 18% against the dollar.Analysts said the steep fall in U.S. equity markets during March led to increased buying of dollars for asset managers seeking to rebalance their portfolios at the end of the month.But the U.S. currency pared gains in the aftermath of the latest Fed move on Tuesday to expand the ability of dozens of foreign central banks to access dollars during the coronavirus crisis.

The Fed starts its two-day meeting Tuesday.\"They might say something about paying attention to global developments, but I wouldn\\'t expect them to do anything at this point,\" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. Strategists expect the Fed has been watching tensions in the Middle East and now the coronavirus.\"They\\'re looking at the global economy and it doesn\\'t look like it will have much affect at the moment,\" he said. It is still unclear how serious the virus will become, or how it will impact the Chinese and other economies. By Monday, the virus had affected 2,900 people and killed 82.On the policy side, the Fed is expected to hold rates steady and not signal any other moves.\"I think the Fed will be silent,\"\\xa0said Joseph Quinlan, head of CIO market strategy at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank. \"They\\'ve come into 2020 with their work done. This is a political year. They\\'ve done their job when it comes to cutting rates. I think they\\'re in wait-and-see mode.\"The biggest issue for markets is when the Fed will slow and ultimately stop its purchases of Treasury bills, an effort credited by some for a surge in liquidity that has helped boost risk assets, particularly stocks, and tighten credit spreads. The Fed began purchasing $60 billion a month to expand its balance sheet and increases reserves, after problems in the short-term funding market created a temporary snap up in overnight rates.The Fed has calmed the short-term lending market with the purchases and also ongoing repurchase, or repo, operations. It has said it would continue its operations to help the repo market through the tax season, when there could be higher-than-normal demand for short-term cash. The repo market is basically the plumbing for the financial markets and is where financial institutions go for short term cash.\"It would be nice if they did discuss it, but I don\\'t know if they\\'re going to or not,\" said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. Briggs said he doesn\\'t expect Powell to reveal much in the way of specifics on how it will wind down its Treasury bill purchases. He expects the Fed to say in March that it is paring back those purchases from $60 billion to $40 billion, and then will taper them down.BlackRock\\'s Rick Rieder said he will be listening for how the Fed describes inflation since it has said it is willing to let it run \"hotter\" than its 2% target, though the measure it watches has not yet met the target. He, too, is looking for clarification on the Fed\\'s plans for its T-bill buying program.He expects the Fed to discuss it by mid-second quarter. \"I think they\\'ll start to taper it down, and I think they\\'ll be very deliberate and prescriptive about how they\\'re going to do that,\" said Rieder, BlackRock\\'s global CIO of fixed income.He said the Fed is adding a lot of liquidity to the financial system on its own, but it is even more massive when combined with the efforts of the People\\'s Bank of China and the European Central Bank.\"I think they\\'ll start to taper down the program some time during or toward the middle or the end of the second quarter,\" he said. \"My sense is they\\'re beginning the discussions but those discussions will gather momentum in the next month or two.\"Rieder said he expects more Fed officials to become concerned about their policy causing too easy financial conditions, boosting stocks and tightening credit spreads. \"My sense is that\\'s going to be very slow in incubating that idea.\"\"The one thing I\\'ve got my eye on is I think at some point in the next couple of months, assuming what is happening now is a relatively near term risk, I think a lot of the discussion is going to head toward financial conditions,\" Rieder said. \"You\\'ve had some of the Fed members talking about financial conditions.\"The Fed is also expected to boost the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. That\\'s a technical tool that it would hope would push its fed funds rate slightly higher. The fed funds rate has been at 1.55%, the low end of its 1.50 to 1.75% range.\"Historically, the Fed has made these adjustments when the funds rate has been trading within 5 basis points of the borders of the target range, as it has recently,\" notes JPMorgan chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli. \"The markets and the public seem to have understood that these technical adjustments do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy and we expect that to continue to be the case next week.\"',\n",

Vaxevanis faces up to two years in prison if convicted.He has said he received the list, named after International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde who gave it to authorities in several EU countries in 2010 when she was French finance minister, from an anonymous source.Another newspaper, daily Ta Nea, also published the 2,059 names, which includes several politicians as well as many businessmen, shippnig magnates, doctors, lawyers and housewives, over 10 pages.It said the accounts had held about 2 billion euros until 2007 but also made clear that there was no evidence any of them had broken tax evasion laws.\",\n",

Amazon said the facility could power the equivalent of 46,000 U.K. homes and would be the U.K.\\'s \"largest corporate wind power purchase agreement.\" Additionally, two solar projects in North Carolina and Virginia will amount to 215 MW of total capacity, with Amazon expecting them to produce 500,997 MWh per year. The projects announced Thursday are expected to start generating energy in 2021. They are not owned by the company, but it says its commitment to purchase their output enables the projects to be built. In a statement issued Thursday, Amazon\\'s Director of Sustainability Kara Hurst said the firm was \"committed to minimizing our carbon emissions and reaching 80% renewable energy use across the company by 2024.\"In June, Amazon was one of more than 700 firms targeted by 88 investors \"for not reporting environmental information.\" The aim of the investors was to push businesses such as Amazon to disclose information via the CDP, a not-for-profit platform which enables companies to divulge environmental performance data.A few months earlier, in April, thousands of Amazon employees signed an open letter to CEO Jeff Bezos and the firm\\'s board of directors, imploring them to take action on climate change.In September, Amazon co-founded an initiative called The Climate Pledge, which asks signatories to become \"net zero carbon across their businesses\" by the year 2040.It has also launched what it calls a \"transparency website\" which it uses to report on what it describes as its \"sustainability commitments, initiatives, and performance.\" The site also has information on the firm\\'s carbon footprint, which it reports as being 44.40 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for the 2018 fiscal year.Amazon is just one of many global technology firms looking to power operations using renewable sources of energy. In March 2019, for example, Microsoft signed a 15-year power purchase agreement for the energy produced by a 74-megawatt solar power facility in North Carolina, while in April 2018 Apple announced its global facilities were powered using \"100 percent clean energy.\"Making sure that its facilities are powered by clean energy is a multi-faceted process for Apple.In its Environmental Responsibility Report covering the 2018 fiscal year the California-headquartered firm said that, where feasible, it sourced renewable energy by building its own projects.

The European companies have until 1600 GMT on Wednesday todeclare their intentions and either scrap their merger or ask UKregulators for more time or finalise their plans to create theworld\\'s largest aerospace and arms group.   \"We will keep going until 5 (pm London time),\" a personinvolved in the negotiations said.   Several sources close to the negotiations said GermanChancellor Angela Merkel had opposed the proposal to combineAirbus passenger airplanes with UK defence contractor BAE.   \"Merkel is against the deal but has not given reasons,\" asource involved in the negotiations said.   A spokesman for the German government declined to comment.   Early on Wednesday EADS said it had no plans to issue astatement in the morning.   At 0925 GMT shares in BAE were down 1.6 percent at 320.2pence in London, while EADS shares were down 0.15 percent at26.065 euros in Paris.   Brinkmanship is common in European negotiations, andFranco-German-led EADS was itself only created after talks aboutits structure collapsed and were resurrected weeks later.   But with the current negotiations taking place in a glare ofpublicity, the margin for manoeuvre is rapidly dwindling.   On Tuesday, French Defence Minister Jean-Yves le Drian saidnegotiations on the merger had moved forward.  \"We had made a lot of progress, I think, but have weprogressed enough? That is up to those who initiated the projectto say,\" the minister said.   But by late that evening it appeared that there were threelines drawn in the sand, each of which excluded one of theBritish, French and German governments, leaving the highlypolitical European merger in danger of collapse.<^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Graphic on EADS/BAE market cap and share prices: Factbox on the two companies:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   THREE-WAY TUSSLE   France and Germany want to keep a strong say in the combinedcompany, while Britain wants to protect BAE from stateownership, which could affect its contracts in the UnitedStates.   Germany and Britain could accept lower state shareholdingsthan is the case at EADS, which is more than half controlled byFrance, Germany and Spain, but France rejects that.   France and Britain, meanwhile, could accept unequal stakesbetween France and Germany, but Berlin demands parity. Sourcesinvolved in the deal said Germany also wanted to ensure therewas a major headquarters in Munich to counter corporate centresin Toulouse, France, and Farnborough, Britain.   Under rules set by the UK Takeover Panel, EADS and BAE canask for an extension to their negotiations, but only if EADS\"has every reason to believe that it can and will continue to beable to implement the offer\".   \"Extending the deadline will not change the dynamics of thenegotiation and would almost certainly weaken the positions ofKing and Enders going forward, as it would signal they felt theyhad no other acceptable options,\" said David Reeths, Directorfor consulting at defence analysts IHS Jane\\'s.   Negotiators described the atmosphere as tense and frustratedas bickering immediately broke out behind the scenes to lay theblame elsewhere in case the talks officially break down.   The merger has faced growing unease from investors in bothcompanies who complained they were ill-prepared and lackinginformation.

              "       'Summer isn\\'t over yet, but the languid pace that has prevailed in Washington since Congress left town in August has now definitively vanished. On every front, the White House and Congress, Republicans and Democrats, are girding for political action that will unfold rapidly with its ultimate consequences uncertain.Let\\'s look at the most important points of engagement: --The elephant in the room: the Iraq war. This is President Bush\\'s top priority and there\\'s no close second. Facing resistance from Congressional Democrats, Bush sought a momentum boost with his surprise visit to Iraq in advance of Gen. David Petraeus\\' testimony on the troop surge in Washington next week. Bush and even some Democrats see signs of military progress; Democratic leaders said the US military commitment isn\\'t leading to political reconciliation that would allow troops to come home. --The new wild card: the economy. When you have a single issue stirring fear and anxiety among hedge fund markets, pension fund investors, and moderate-income homeowners, there\\'s potential for a powerful political reaction. That\\'s what the mortgage mess has produced. Bush responded last week with his limited assistance proposals, while Democrats want more -- including potential cash bailouts. This may be one area where Democratic and Republican choose to work together. --The old battle: taxes and spending. Republicans bruised by the unpopularity of Iraq and scandal drama (see: Craig, Larry) are spoiling to battle Democrats over one of their familiar themes. That\\'s what Bush is threatening to veto spending bills from the Democratic Congress, and almost certainly would do the same if Democrats could muster the votes to raise taxes on private equity. The GOP badly needs to reclaim the tax-spending brand. --The backdrop: the 2008 elections. The campaign trail has almost supplanted Washington as the focus of national attention already. And that trend will only increase. A Wednesday night debate in New Hampshire will showcase the tightrope Republican candidates have to walk between distancing themselves from an unpopular White House and building support among the Republican base. The next morning, the new Republican candidate, Fred Thompson will enter the race in Iowa (having appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" on the same night of that GOP debate).',\n",

In many developing countries, private education is a must-have for parents who want their children to succeed.Across the world, the cost of private education has risen faster than incomes. In the U.S., private high schools cost over $40,000, compared to a median income of around $50,000.  In the U.K., boarding school fees jumped 65 percent from 1992 to 2008, while household incomes increased only 30 percent over the same period, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.We’ve put together a list of the countries with the most expensive private schools based on the cost of sending a child to one of the top three or four private schools in that country.We used annual tuition fees for high school students for both day and boarding schools. Since boarding is often the more expensive option, we ranked the countries by boarding fees, except in the cases of China and Brazil.The fees we considered include boarding, food and basic curriculum costs, but exclude charges such as registration fees, deposits, extra-curricular activities and field trips.

GfK market research group said on Wednesday its forward-looking  consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of around 2,000  people, rose to 7.1 going into October from an upwardly revised  7.0 the previous month.  The original September figure was 6.9 and analysts in a Reuters  poll had forecast the October reading at 7.0.

A sub-index tracking consumers\\' income expectations eased, albeit  from a high level, due to rising food prices, which dampened  perceived purchasing power.  \"It\\'s also possible that some consumers fear further financial  burdens due to the euro crisis or tax hikes,\" the GfK said,  referring to the outcome of the German election which was still  uncertain at the time of the survey.

              "       'Kraft and Mondelez are taking the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to court in a bid to keep the agency from discussing a $16 million fine to settle allegations of manipulating the wheat markets.The two food companies agreed to pay the fine as part of a deal with the CFTC that the companies say restricted what regulators could say about the case. Kraft and Mondelez, which was created when Kraft split into two companies in 2012, are now suing the CFTC for contempt. They filed a motion in federal court in Chicago on Friday, saying the regulator violated the order in an Aug. 15 press release announcing the deal.\"The CFTC and its Commissioners engaged in a deliberate, orchestrated effort to violate the Court\\'s Consent Order within minutes of its entry,\" the companies said in the filing. The two sides face off in court Sept. 12, according to court documents.According to the CFTC, Kraft intentionally drove down the price of wheat in 2011 by buying an excessive amount of futures contracts on the grain.Food companies have made such moves to hedge fluctuations in commodities prices by agreeing to pay a specific price at a specific date in the future. Unlike a hedge fund or trading firm, companies like Kraft are limited in their futures purchases and are prohibited from speculating.Kraft was allowed to have a futures position of roughly 3 million bushels of wheat, the CFTC said in the original complaint. Instead, Kraft allegedly bought futures contracts for 15.75 million bushels, worth more than $93 million.The consent order included a clause that read \"neither party shall make any public statement about this case other than to refer to the terms of this settlement agreement or public documents filed in this case.\"The order also prohibited the CFTC from saying whether either defendant violated federal law.After the agreement, the CFTC issued a press release on Aug. 15 saying the penalty was \"valued at three times the alleged gain\" and included statements from Chairman Heath P. Tarbert and links to statements from individual commissioners.\"Market manipulation inflicts real pain on farmers by denying them the fair value of their hard work and crops,\" Tarbert said in his statement. \"It also hurts American families by raising the costs of putting food on the table. Instances of market manipulation are precisely the kinds of cases the CFTC was founded to pursue.\"The CFTC told the court Saturday that its public statements didn\\'t violate the order and that its individual commissioners were not bound by the agreement. The CFTC voluntarily removed the announcement from its website until the next court appearance.The CFTC and Kraft declined to comment for this article. Mondelez did not respond to a request for comment.The segments of Kraft and Mondelez named as defendants in the case were part of the same company in 2011 when the trades took place. In 2012, Kraft Foods changed its name to Mondelez and spun off Kraft Foods Group Inc., which merged with Heinz in 2015 to form the Kraft Heinz Co.Kraft\\'s futures position in 2011 represented 87% of the active futures market for that particular month and type of wheat, according to the CFTC. The agency accused the company of taking this position to try to lower the price of wheat in the spot market where it was buying the grain.With Kraft signaling to the market that it intended to change its normal plan and buy wheat through the futures market instead of the spot market, the price of wheat in the futures market rose and the cash price fell, allowing Kraft to reap a profit, according to the complaint.When the company bought wheat in the spot market and unwound a large portion of its futures position, it generated a gain of more than $5 million, according to the CFTC.Some companies are allowed to file for exemptions to the caps on futures positions for hedging purposes. The CFTC said Kraft did not have an exemption and that its futures position represented a six-month supply of the wheat it needed at its Toledo area-flour mill and was not for legitimate business purposes.The regulator also said Kraft performed illegal offsetting trades of futures contracts with itself.Kraft has been one of the worst-performing large cap stocks in 2019, shedding more than 40% of its share price this year. The stock of Mondelez International, the parent company of the defendant in this suit, is up more than 35% this year.Clarification: The headline of this article was changed to clarify that Kraft hasn\\'t filed a new lawsuit against the CFTC. The company filed a contempt motion in an already existing lawsuit by the agency.',\n",

Only 17 countries now recognize Taiwan.China and Taiwan have fought a tug-of-war for diplomatic recognition in the South Pacific for decades, with some island nations switching allegiances for financial gain.John Moffat Fugui, a Solomons\\' parliamentarian and head of a taskforce charged with evaluating diplomatic ties, said on Wednesday that Beijing would pay into a fund even though it usually preferred \"grants, concessionary loans and sometimes gifts\".\"But for you, we will give you a 1/8Rural Constituency Development Fund 3/8 for a certain period,\" Fugui said, referring to recent negotiations with Beijing officials.Fugui said the offer would help fill an immediate gap should the Solomons cut ties with Taiwan that date back to 1983.Taiwan has pledged $8.5 million to the Solomons in 2019-20 through a fund, budget documents show.The Solomons, an archipelago of just over 600,000 people, relies heavily on such payments due to its limited means of generating income, which is largely through timber exports.The South Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where formal ties with six of the 16 island nations make up more than a third of its total alliances.A report by the Australia-based Lowy Institute think-tank last month said: \"Both Australia and the U.S. are concerned about whether Solomon Islands chooses to switch recognition from Taiwan to China\". It said \"a switch by any one (of the states that recognize Taiwan) may stimulate others\" to abandon Taipei.Fugui spoke positively about a potential switch in ties at a parliamentary committee in the capital of Honiara on Wednesday, although he said the taskforce had not yet completed its report.Separately, the government has convened a ministerial team that has been liaising directly with Beijing.An observer at the meetings told Reuters that: \"The government is trying to make a relationship with China now; but to formalize it we need to wait for the report.\" The meeting was open to the public, but has not been broadcast.China\\'s foreign ministry in Beijing did not immediately respond to questions.Joanne Ou, spokeswoman for Taiwan\\'s foreign ministry, said: \"Relationship with Solomon Islands currently is stable, but we are closely monitoring and situation and development.\"Solomon Islands has been actively assessing its Taiwan alliance since a general election in April.Anti-graft agency Transparency Solomon Islands has urged caution in changing ties over concerns Solomons will not be able to hold firm against Beijing\\'s interests.\"It is not a secret that China is the most assertive donor nation offering funding and development assistance that exploit governance gaps in countries with weak or corrupt structures, and makes the gaps wider,\" Transparency Solomon Islands said in a statement last month.The number of nations recognizing Taiwan has been dwindling, with El Salvador in Central America, Burkina Faso in West Africa and the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean, all switching to China last year.',\n",

              "       'As horrible as they may seem, sell-offs are inevitable, Cramer said. But instead of panicking when a downturn happens, investors should see opportunity.There’s always a bull market somewhere, and there are opportunities in every market. That’s especially the case during a correction because stocks go on sale when the market drops. So instead of gnashing their teeth for not sidestepping a sell-off – an “amateurish pipedream,” Cramer called it – investors should take the chance to buy great companies on the cheap.This is why Cramer recommended having at least 5% of a portfolio in cash. So investors are ready when it’s time to pounce. If stocks have had a bigger run than usual, meaning some type of correction could be coming, 10% might be better. The bottom line: Big declines will always happen. But smart investors with readily available cash can take advantage of them.Questions for Cramer?

              "       'Hurricane Ida was on the verge of making landfall in the United States on Sunday as an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm that could plunge much of the Louisiana shoreline underwater as the state grapples with a Covid-19 surge already taxing hospitals.Ida gathered more strength overnight, faster than meteorologists had predicted only a day ago. It is the toughest test yet for the hundreds of miles of new levees built around New Orleans after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall 16 years ago to the day, inundating historically Black neighborhoods and killing more than 1,800 people.Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that the storm, due to make landfall by Sunday afternoon, could be the state\\'s worst direct hit by a hurricane since the 1850s.The state is also dealing with the nation\\'s third-highest rate of new COVID-19 infections, with about 3,400 new cases reported on Friday alone. Hospitals were treating some 2,450 COVID-19 patients, Edwards said, with those in many of the state\\'s parishes already nearing capacity.By early Sunday, Ida was a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. At 11 a.m. CDT (1600 GMT) it was located about 60 miles (95 km) west-southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and some 85 miles (135 km) south of New Orleans, carrying top sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).Rain gusted through New Orleans on Sunday morning, where retired 68-year-old Robert Ruffin had evacuated with his family to a downtown hotel from their home in the city\\'s east.\"I thought it was safer,\" he said. \"It\\'s double trouble this time because of COVID.\"IDA\\'s landfall was only a few hours away, according to the NHC, which warned of life-threatening storm surges, potentially catastrophic wind damage and flooding rainfall.\"We\\'re as prepared as we can be, but we\\'re worried about those levees,\" said Kirk Lepine, president of Plaquemines Parish on the state\\'s Gulf Coast.Plaquemines is one of the most vulnerable parishes, where 23,000 people live along the Mississippi delta stretching into the Gulf. Lepine feared levees along Highway 23 were not up to task.\"Water could go over top,\" he said. \"That\\'s our one road in and out.\"Edwards told CNN on Sunday that he believed the state\\'s levees would be able to withstand the storm surge, though he expressed some doubt about parishes, like Plaquemines, in the south.\"Where we\\'re less confident is further south where you have other protection systems that are not built to that same standard,\" he said. \"That\\'s where we are most concerned about the impact of storm surge.\"He said on Saturday there were no plans to evacuate patients from hospitals, and that state officials had been speaking with hospitals to ensure their generators were working and that they had more water on hand than normal.Officials ordered widespread evacuations of low-lying and coastal areas, jamming highways and leading some gasoline stations to run dry as residents and vacationers fled.\"This is a powerful and dangerous storm.

I like Chevron very much.\"An attractive dividend is the primary reason to consider owning an oil stock right now, Cramer suggested.Outside of Chevron, Cramer said two other oil plays that carry slightly more risk are Devon and Pioneer Natural Resources. While both companies have solid variable dividends, he stressed that \"their payouts could shrink as oil comes down.\"The price of crude slid in recent weeks and on Thursday closed in the red for the sixth-straight session, touching its lowest level since May.The U.S. oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude futures, dropped 2.7% to settle at $63.69 per barrel. Brent crude, which is the international benchmark, declined about 2% to just under $67 per barrel.After a red-hot start to the year, oil has faced weakness due, in part, to concerns about slowing demand as the coronavirus pandemic persists around the world. Comments this week about a potential change to the Federal Reserve\\'s highly accommodative monetary policy also caused the U.S. dollar to strengthen. That can end up hurting oil because it makes crude more costly for overseas buyers.In July, as WTI traded above $72 per barrel, Cramer said he believed oil had put in its near-term top. He said Thursday more weakness could be ahead, as an increase in supply clashes with a slump in demand. Investors who are looking to buy an oil stock need to be mindful of that, Cramer said.\"Be careful, because oil ... may not be done rolling over yet,\" he said. \"I don\\'t know if oil can even hold above $60 these days. Most American producers are still plenty profitable above $60, but below that level, it does start to get more dicey.\"',\n",

The shares are still down about 5 percent this year, roughly in line with the loss for the broader S&P 500 energy sector.Chevron reported a $4 billion profit for the third quarter of 2018, more than double its earnings during the same period a year ago. The San Ramon, California-based company pumped at a record level last quarter, and executives said they now expect to hit the upper range of their guidance for oil and gas output for the year.Credit Suisse on Monday upgraded the company\\'s stock to outperform from neutral. The investment bank maintained its price target of $138 on the shares.The bank said Chevron \"continues to execute on its already superior growth outlook,\" even as its stock trades at a \"wider than normal\" discount to fellow U.S.-headquartered oil major Exxon Mobil.Chevron now says it expects its oil and gas production to grow at the top end of its previously forecast range of 4 percent to 7 percent.That should yield better capital efficiency in 2018 and boost free cash flow, in Credit Suisse\\'s view. Healthier cash flow will allow Chevron\\'s management to reward investors with a competitive quarterly dividend payment and potentially expand its $3 billion per year share buyback program, the bank said.The engine behind Chevron\\'s growing output is its Wheatstone and Gorgon natural gas projects in Australia, the Permian Basin underlying Texas and New Mexico and several offshore projects, according to Credit Suisse.',\n",

The Ford spokesman declined to give the model\\'s anticipated production volume or describe the model other than to say it is an SUV.The Changan-Ford joint venture is in the process of getting approval for this move to produce Lincoln vehicles locally in China, said the spokesman.Lincoln China President Amy Marentic told Reuters in October that the brand was studying whether to produce cars locally in China.Lincoln was accelerating its entry into China with plans to have 65 Lincoln stores by the end of 2016, instead of previous plans of 60, with 80 planned for year-end 2017, she said.Marentic said the company would also open five to 10 smaller sales branches to tap into fast-growing auto sales in lower-tier Chinese cities.',\n",

The tariffs will go into effect later this month.The end goal in Trump's eyes is for these countries to lower the tariffs they have on American goods, thus improving the market for the U.S. Some say his plan could work as the U.S. is negotiating from a position of strength -- a strong economy and low unemployment rates.But as the fight continues, some companies are having to absorb the blow.

              "       \"Meet Amanda Campbell, 24 from Kingston. She's a well-spoken  graduate from UCL, where she  studied interdisciplinary architecture.  She is also a huge music festival fan having attended more than  30 since her first one at the age of 16.   Her idea is Comp-A-Tent, a fully compostable tent. Its primary  use is for festivals, in order to counter the environmental  impact of leaving tents behind once the party is over. Simply,  you buy the tent with your festival ticket, pitch it, enjoy the  festival, then when it's time to leave, you hand it into the  recycling bin area and it then decomposes at the same rate as  bread.   Her reasons for developing the tent came from personal  frustration from being at festivals and witnessing the number of  tents dumped, abandoned and otherwise left behind. She learned  that, on average, one in five tents are left behind at European  festivals, contributing over 750,000 tents every year to landfill  or incineration. These tents aren't feasibly recycled, never  break down and leach hazardous toxins. It is a problem that  plagues festivals. At Glastonbury this year, the clear up  cost for organisers was £780,000 ($990,000).   From China, Amanda would like to source materials and  manufacturing for her pilot launch. Currently Amanda has been  making prototypes with a hand iron and it takes over one day per  tent. Amanda would like to find a factory in China with a faster  manufacturing process so that it can get down to the target price  of £40 per tent.\",\n",

All references must be sourced to CNBC. QUICK: AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH THE NUMBERS ON THIS  DEAL AGAIN IT IS BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY BUYING PRECISION CASTPARTS  THIS IS A DEAL THAT THEY ARE VALUING AT 37 BILLION DOLLARS JUST  LOOKING AT THE PRESS RELEASE.  WARREN BUFFETT IS CALLING  INTO  THE CONTROL ROOM IS JUST A MINUTE THEY ARE PAYING $235  PER SHARE IN CASH THIS IS A STOCK THAT CLOSED AT $193.88 ON  FRIDAY SO WE WILL BE TALKING MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS.  I THINK  RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE WARREN BUFFETT ON THE LINE. SIR ARE YOU  THERE? SO WE SEE THE NEWS THAT IS OUT TODAY THIS COMES AS A  SURPRISE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL DID  REPORT THIS ON SATURDAY I WONDER WHEN DID YOU FIRST HEAR ABOUT  THIS, WHEN DID YOU FIRST TALK TO THIS COMPANY AND HOW DID THIS  DEAL HAPPEN? BUFFETT:  I WOULD SAY IS WAS ABOUT 5 WEEKS AGO.   YOU HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO TODD COMBS FOR THE DEAL WE HIRED TODD  ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO TO MANAGE MONEY AND HE MANAGES ABOUT 9 BILLION  NOW AND MAYBE THREE OR SO YEARS AGO  HE ADDED PRECISION TO  HIS PORTFOLIO AND I REALLY NEVER HEARD ABOUT THE COMPANY BEFORE  THAT AND TODD TOLD ME A LOT ABOUT IT AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS  I HAVE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH IT AND ABOUT 5 OR SO WEEKS AGO THE  CEO MARK DONEGAN ALONG WITH HIS CFO AND IR PERSON CAME BY  BERKSHIRE THEY WERE SEEING BERKSHIRE HOLDERS AND THEY MET WITH  TODD AND THEN I DROPPED IN ON THE VISIT AND IN THE LAST 15  MINUTES OR SO AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY MARK AND OF COURSE I  HAD BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE COMPANY SO SHORTLY THEREAFTER I STOPPED  AND GIVE THEM A CALL TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE OFFENDED IF WE MADE  A BID AND THEY DIDN\\'T INDICATE THEY WERE PARTICULARLY RECEPTIVE  BUT THEY ALSO INDICATED THEY WOULD LISTEN SO I SUBSEQUENTLY MADE  A BID. I MET MARK OUT AT SUN VALLEY, HE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE AIR  MOST OF THE TIME AND SO HE CAME BY BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR THE  ALLEN COMPANY CONFERENCE AND I MADE HIM A BID AND HE TOOK IT TO  THE BOARD AND BEFORE LONG WE HAD A DEAL. SORKIN:  WARREN I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU I SAW BECKY THE  WEEK AFTER SUN VALLEY AND I SAID BUT WARREN IS DOING A DEAL I HAD  SEEN YOU AT SUN VALLEY. YOU HAD THAT PHONE WITH YOU SO INTENSE  THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON AND I THOUGHT I DIDN\\'T REALIZE THIS  IS WHAT YOU WERE DOING.  BUFFETT: I WILL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN I AM AROUND YOU  ANDREW IF YOU CAN READ MY FACE LIKE THAT.  SORKIN: FROM A PRICE PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE  HAD FROM AN EBITA I WAS DOING IT OFF OF THE $30 BILLION AND  THINKING THIS WAS ABOUT 20 TIMES EBITA WHICH I WAS SAYING NOT THE  CHEAPEST DEAL IN TOWN.  IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO SPEND A LOT OF  MONEY QUICKLY.  IN TERMS OF THE VALUATION THOUGH HOW DO YOU  THINK ABOUT IT AND WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING THIS KIND  OF MONEY IS IT HARDER AND HARDER AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER  TO ACTUALLY GET A REALLY CHEAP DEAL? BUFFETT: IT IS NOT 20 TIMES EBITA THOUGH ANDREW. I AM NOT  SURE WHAT FIGURES YOU ARE LOOKING AT THERE BUT ALL DEALS SEEM  EXPENSIVE TO ME BUT THIS ONE WE ARE CERTAINLY PAYING A VERY GOOD  PRICE FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY COMPANY RUN BY A PERSON THAN AS FAR AS  I AM CONCERNED HE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT WHAT HE  DOES.  SORKIN: HE\\'S MADE A NUMBER OF DEALS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF  YEARS ABOUT 8 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF TRANSACTIONS WHEN YOU LOOK  AT THIS COMPANY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS DO YOU IMAGINE  USING A LOT OF BERKSHIRE CASH TO MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS TO  USE IT AS A ROLL UP VEHICLE IF YOU WILL? BUFFETT: WELL ITS ALWAYS ACQUIRED COMPANIES I DON\\'T KNOW  HOW MANY ACQUISITIONS THEY MADE OVER THE YEARS BUT IT IS A LOT.   BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT GO INTO AEROSPACE IN  THE WAY OF PARTS AND THEY\\'VE GONE AFTER ONE ITEM AFTER ANOTHER  OVER THE YEARS.  IN FACT THEY\\'VE MADE A COUPLE SMALL DEALS I  BELIEVE IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER AND I THINK THEY\\'VE GOT MAYBE  ONE PENDING OR SO.  NOW THEY MAKE A GOOD BIT OF MONEY SO  THEY WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO DO THE ACQUISITIONS OR MANY OF THE  ACQUISITIONS INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS BUT IF THEY NEED ANY  MONEY FROM BERKSHIRE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS CALL.  QUICKLY: WARREN THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE DEAL IS THIS THE MOST  EXPENSIVE DEAL EVER?  HOW DOES IT MATCH UP TO BURLINGTON  NORTHERN? BUFFETT: WELL THE MOST DEALS ARE THE ONES THAT DON\\'T WORK  OUT.  YOU MENTIONED DEXTER SHOE A LITTLE WHILE AGO. BUT IN  TERMS OF PRICE EARNINGS MULTIPLES GOING IN THIS IS RIGHT UP THERE  AT THE TOP NOW WHEN WE BOUGHT BURLINGTON THAT WAS A HIGH PE BUT  IT WAS OFF A VERY DEPRESSED FIGURE BECAUSE WE BOUGHT THAT IN THE  FALL OF 2009 WHEN EARNINGS WERE AT A TROUGH.  AND PRECISIONS  EARNINGS HAVE FALLEN OFF MODERATELY BECAUSE OF DEVELOPMENTS IN  THE OIL AND GAS FIELD WHERE THEY DO SOME BUSINESS AS WELL AS IN  AEROSPACE SO BUT THIS IS A VERY HIGH MULTIPLE FOR US. SULLIVAN: YOU READ MY MIND ON OIL AND GAS HOW MUCH OF THIS  IF AT ALL IS A BET THAT THE U.S. OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY MAY BE  BOTTOMING OUT AT LEAST FROM A PRICE PERSPECTIVE? BUFFETT: WELL WE ARE GOING TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A 100  YEARS SO IT DOESN\\'T REALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT OIL AND GAS  DOES IN THE NEXT YEAR IN TERMS OF US BUYING IT.  IF SOMEONE  TOLD ME FOR SURE THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS WAS GOING TO BE IN THE  DULDRUMS WE\\'LL SAY FOR 3 YEARS I STILL WOULD HAVE MADE THE  DEAL.  THAT\\'S NOT A PREDICTION I AM JUST SAYING IT IS NOT  IMPORTANT TO US HOW LONG THE OIL AND GAS SLUMP LASTS WHEN YOU GET  A CHANCE TO BUY A WONDERFUL COMPANY YOU KNOW THERE IS USUALLY  SOME REASON WHY YOU ARE GETTING THAT CHANCE AND PERHAPS THE SLUMP  IN OIL AND GAS HELPS US IN THIS CASE.  BUT THERE WILL BE  SOMEDAY THERE WILL BE A SLUMP IN AEROSPACE AND THAT WILL BE MUCH  MORE SEVERE FOR A COMPANY LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU LOOK OVER THE  DECADES BOTH OIL AND GAS AND AEROSPACE WILL BE GOOD BUSINESS AND  THESE FELLOWS ARE THEIR KEY PARTICULARLY IN THE AEROSPACE  BUSINESS THE INDUSTRY NEEDS THEM THEY\\'RE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS  THE MOST RELIABLE INNOVATIVE  DEPENDABLE SUPPLIER OF VERY  KEY PARTS THAT GO INTO ALL KINDS OF AIRCRAFTS.  SORKIN: WARREN SPEAK TO THE DEFENSIVE MODE THAT YOU OFTEN  TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PARTICULAR COMPANY IN TERMS OF  ITS MARKETSHARE AND ITS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN IF NOT GROW THAT  MARKETSHARE BUFFETT:  WELL WHAT YOU NEED IS YOU NEED PEOPLE THAT  HAVE PHYSICAL FACILITIES BUT THAT IS A SMALL PART OF IT.   THEY DO HAVE MARVELOUS PHYSICAL FACILITIES BUT WHAT YOU REALLY  NEED IS BRAIN POWER AND YOU NEED PARTICULARLY AT THE TOP YOU NEED  SOMEBODY WITH A TOTAL PASSION FOR THE BUSINESS AND I\\'VE MET MARK  FOUR OR FIVE TIMES AND EACH TIME HE\\'S BEEN IN THE AIR AND HE\\'S IN  THE AIR ALMOST A THOUSAND HOURS A YEAR THIS FELLOW LOVES THIS  BUSINESS LIKE I LOVE BERKSHIRE AND HE\\'S A LOT BETTER AT IT THAN I  AM AT BERKSHIRE. YOU CAN\\'T FIND PEOPLE LIKE THIS.  YOU  CERTAINLY CAN\\'T HIRE THEM.  THE ONE THING I GUARANTEE MARK  IS THAT HE\\'S RUNNING THE COMPANY.  PEOPLE LIKE THIS ARE VERY  VERY RARE.  YOU CAN SEE IT IN WHAT HE HAS BUILT AND YOU CAN  SEE IT IN THE PASSION HE\\'S GOT FOR WHAT HE IS DOING NOW.   HE\\'S NEVER SATISFIED IN TERMS OF GETTING MORE BUSINESS IN THE  AIRFRAME AND THE ENGINES.  HE\\'S NEVER SATISFIED IN TERMS OF  GETTING HIS COST TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE.  HE JUST HAS A  PASSION FOR THE BUSINESS. QUICK:  WARREN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN TERMS OF THE  CASH THAT YOU ARE USING FOR THIS?  I KNOW YOU LIKE TO KEEP  ABOUT 20 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH ON HAND.  ARE YOU STILL IN  THE MARKET FOR OTHER POTENTIAL DEALS? OR DOES THIS TAKE YOU OUT  OF THE MARKET FOR AWHILE? BUFFETT: THIS TAKES US OUT OF THE MARKET FOR AN ELEPHANT  BUT WE WILL PROBABLY BE BUYING A FEW SMALL THINGS IN THE NEXT 6  MONTHS.  WE ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS ON A COUPLE BUT IN TERMS OF  A DEAL OF SIMILAR SIZE IT PRETTY MUCH TAKES US OUT.  WHAT WE  WILL PROBABLY DO ON THIS ONE WE WILL PROBABLY BORROW ABOUT 10  BILLION AND USE ABOUT 23 BILLION OF OUR OWN CASH ON THAT  ORDER.  WE\\'LL BE LEFT WITH OVER 40 BILLION PROBABLY IN CASH  WHEN WE GET ALL THROUGH.  BUT I LIKE TO HAVE A LOT OF CASH  AT ALL TIMES SO THIS MEANS WE HAVE TO RELOAD OVER THE NEXT 12  MONTHS OR SO BUT IT DOESN\\'T PRECLUDE DOING SMALLER DEALS BUT WE  WILL BE DOING A FEW PROBABLY. SORKIN: AND WARREN ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS YOU ALWAYS  TALK ABOUT TALENT AND SPECIAL PEOPLE AND SPECIAL BERKSHIRE PEOPLE  AND IT IS HARD TO FIND THEM.  WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT MARK DARE  I ASK THE QUESTION SHOULD WE START TO ADD HIM TO THE LIST OF  POTENTIAL PEOPLE THAT MAY ONLY RUN THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY NOW  BUT MAYBE PUT INTO THE BERKSHIRE FOLD WHEN IT SOMES TO  SUCCESSION? BUFFETT: IF I READ MARK CORRECTLY AND IN THIS RESPECT I AM  SURE I DO ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS RUN PRECISION AND TO TAKE IT TO  GREATER AND GREATER HEIGHTS HE DOES NOT WANT TO RUN  BERKSHIRE  AND TRUE OF MOST OF OUR MANAGERS THEY LOVE WHAT  THEY ARE DOING THAT\\'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.  I HAVE TO DECIDE  REALLY WHEN I BUY A COMPANY THERE IS NO WAY IN THE WORLD THAT I  COULD RUN PRECISION OR REALLY ANYBODY IN OUR OPERATION COULD SO  THE FIRST I ASK AND MARK\\'S 58 I ASK IF HE HAS ANY IDEAS AT 65  THAT HE\\'S GO AND PLAY SHUFFLE BOARD IN FLORIDA OR SOMETHING LIKE  THAT.  AS LONG AS WE TREAT HIM RIGHT NOW WE\\'VE GOT TO TREAT  PEOPLE RIGHT WE TREAT HIM RIGHT HE WILL BE RUNNING THIS FOR  DECADES AND DECADES. AND THAT\\'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO JUST LIKE I  LIKE RUNNING BERKSHIRE. QUICK: WARREN YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS WILL TAKE YOU OUT OF  THE HUNT FOR A BIG ELEPHANT FOR 12 MONTHS OR SO WHILE THE COMPANY  RELOADS WITH THE CASH  CONTINUALLY COMING IN.  JUST  LAST WEEK BILL ACKMAN MADE IT PUBLIC THAT HE HAS A LARGE STAKE IN  MONDELEZ ONE OF THE THINGS HE THOUGHT ABOUT IS POTENTIALLY  MONDELZ GETTING LUMPED IN WITH KRAFT HEINZ.  DOES THAT MEAN  IT IS NOT AN OPTION AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BILL\\'S  PROPOSAL? BUFFETT: WELL I WILL LISTEN TO ANYTHING MY FRIENDS AT 3G  WANT TO DO BUT WITH KRAFT HEINZ WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US  FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.  I THINK IT IS QUITE UNLIKELY YOU  NEVER WANT TO SAY ANYTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT I THINK IT IS QUITE  UNLIKELY THAT KRAFT HEINZ WOULD BE DOING A BIG ACQUISITION IN THE  NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD I WOULDN\\'T BE  SURPRISED.  BUT IT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SENSE FINANCIALLY  AND FRANKLY MOST OF THE FOOD COMPANIES SELL AT PRICES THAT IT  WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR US TO MAKE A DEAL EVEN IF WE HAD DONE ALL  OF THE WORK NEEDED AT KRAFT HEINZ.  A LOT OF THE COMPANIES  ARE SELLING AT PRICES THAT SORT OF REFLECT IMPROVEMENTS IN THEM  THAT PEOPLE SORT OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING AT KRAFT HEINZ AND  BELIEVE ME THIS IS NOT EASY. QUICK: MEANING THAT MONDELEZ AT THESE PRICES YOU WOULDN\\'T  LIKE? BUFFETT: WELL IT WOULD BE HARD FOR US TO MAKE A DEAL THAT  MAKES SENSE YEAH. BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THE LINE BUT IF  YOU LOOK AT KELLOGG OR CAMPBELL\\'S SOUP  OR MONDELEZ THEY\\'RE  PRICES TO SOME EXTENT THE MARKET HAS PUT INTO THOSE COMPANIES  PRICES THAT REFLECT AN EXPECTATION KRAFT HEINZ TYPE MARGINS ARE  POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY BE THE CASE BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN IT  ELSEWHERE. SULLIVAN: MR BUFFETT IN 2009 MANY OF THE BANKS CAME TO YOU  FOR HELP. HAVE YOU HAD ANY OIL OR GAS COMPANIES COME TO YOU IN  THE LAST FEW MONTHS LOOKING FOR YOUR HELP, LOOKING FOR YOUR  INVESTMENT? BUFFETT: NOT YET BUT PRICES STAY DOWN HERE.  IF PRICES  STAY DOWN HERE SO FAR I WOULD SAY THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE  OIL AND GAS BUSINESS UP MAYBE UNTIL VERY RECENTLY THEY FELT THAT  OIL PRICES WOULD BOUNCE BACK.  THEY MAY NOT HAVE FELT GAS  PRICES WOULD BOUNCE MUCH BUT THEY FELT OIL PRICES WOULD BOUNCE  BACK.  THE OIL PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SELLING ON A  BASIS NOT OF $45 WTI THEY HAVE ASSUMED HIGHER PRICES AND OF  COURSE THE FORWARD CURVE HAVE REFLECTED HIGHER PRICES.  I  THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO MAKE REALISTIC DEALS WITH OIL  AND GAS UP UNTIL NOW BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE  FUTURE.  TO BE SPECIFIC NOBODY HAS COME TO ME. QUICK: DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE NOT MADE ANY OTHER  PURCHASES IN THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS? BUFFETT: THAT\\'S CORRECT QUICK: SO THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU\\'VE SEEN ASIDE FROM THIS  DEAL TODAY THAT YOU THINK HAS BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY YOU WOULD BUY  INTO? BUFFETT: NO OF COURSE THIS IS KIND OF SECENDARY I WOULDN\\'T  SAY MAYBE 15% OF PRECISION\\'S BUSINESS HAD BEEN IN THERE AND THEY  GOT HURT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE  WHEN OIL SLOWS DOWN IF THEY\\'VE GOT VARIOUS BUILDING EQUIPMENT ON  HAND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY DON\\'T NEED TO ORDER ANY FOR AWHILE EVEN  THOUGH CONTINUE TO PRODUCE.  SO NO WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY  COMMITMENTS IN OIL AND GAS. SORKIN: HEY WARREN EVERY TIME  I SEE YOU I ALWAYS ASK  THE QUESTION IBM, IBM UPDATE THE STOCK IS TRADING I THINK ABOUT  155 DOLLARS RIGHT ABOUT NOW HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT IT BUFFETT: I FEEL FINE. SORKIN: WHAT\\'S YOUR BASIS IN THAT COMPANY AT THIS  POINT? BUFFETT: WHAT\\'S OUR STOCK COST US? SORKIN: YEH BUFFETT: I WOULD SAY AROUND 170 SORKIN: AROUND 17O NOW BY MY MATH YOU HAVE ACTUALLY MADE  THE MONEY STILL ON THIS DEAL ON PART I THINK THE FUNCTION OF THE  DIVIDENDS BUT YOU ARE NOT CONCERNED AT ALL IN TERMS OF THE  STOCK BUFFETT: I LOVE IT WHEN IT GOES DOWN IT MEANS THE COMPANY  BUYS STOCK CHEAPER AND MEANS IF I WANT TO BUY MORE STOCK YOU CAN  LOOK AT OUR 13F IN A FEW DAYS IT MEANS I GET TO BUY IT  CHEAPER QUICK: DOES THAT MEAN YOU\\'VE BEEN BUYING IT? BUFFETT: I AM NOT A SELLER OF STOCK.  PEOPLE ASSUME  WHEN WE BUY SOME STOCK WE WANT IT TO GO UP.  WE DON\\'T WANT  IT TO GO UP MAYBE OBVIOUSLY EVENTUALLY MAYBE FIVE OR TEN YEARS  FROM NOW BUT WE LOVE THE IDEA OF A COMPANY BUYING ITS STOCK  CHEAPER. I MEAN THAT\\'S HAPPENED AT AMERICAN EXPRESS FOR INSTANCE  AMERICAN EXPRESS IS A REGULAR REPURCHASER OF SHARES AND WE OWN  15% OF IT AND OWNERSHIP GOES UP FASTER IF THE STOCK IS DOWN THAN  IF THE STOCK IS UP.  SULLIVAN: WE HAD ON FRIDAY A BILLION DOLLAR ACTIVIST  INVESTMENT IN AMERICAN EXPRESS MR BUFFETT JEFFREY UBEN OF  VALUEACT CAPITAL.  WHEN YOU OWN A STOCK LIKE AN AMERICAN  EXPRESS ARE YOU HAPPY TO SEE AN ACTIVIST COME IN DO YOU WELCOME  IT. BUFFETT: NO NOT PARTICULARLY BUT IT IS UP TO THEM WHAT THEY  DO WITH THEIR MONEY.  ACTUALLY IT SENDS UP FOUR OR FIVE  POINTS SO THE EXTENT THAT AMERICAN EXPRESS IS REPURCHASING SHARES  WE CAN\\'T BUY STOCKS IN AMERICAN EXPRESS BECAUSE IT IS A  BANKHOLDING COMPANY AND WE OWN OVER 10% BUT THE CHEAPER THE STOCK  IS THE MORE SHARES AMERICAN EXPRESS WILL BE ABLE TO REPURCHASE  FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF MONEY AND ON BALANCE THAT HELPS US WE\\'RE  BUYING YOU KNOW THERE IS NO MORAL PROBLEM ATTACHED TO IT BECAUSE  IT TAKES PLACE IN THE MARKET BUT WE\\'RE ON OUR PARTNERS  CHEAPER. QUICK: LET\\'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS ALSO A LOT  CHEAPER THAN IT WAS A WEEK AGO YOU LOOKS AT THE MEDIA STOCKS  DISNEY KICKED IT OFF WHEN BOB IGER SAID THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT  ESPN, VERY BRIEF CONCERNS FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE THE MARKET TOOK  THAT AS A HUGE SELLING POINT NOT ONLY FOR DISNEY BUT ALL OF THE  MEDIA RELATED STOCKS DO YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THE MEDIA INDUSTRY  YOU LIKE AT THESE PRICES? BUFFETT: NO I WOULD SAY THAT I CONSIDER BOB IGER AND I KNOW  HIM WELL AND HAD EXPERIENCE WITH HIM MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO I  THINK HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT MANAGERS IN AMERICA AND A GOOD GUY  BEYOND THAT BUT I\\'M AN OBSERVER OF THE MEDIA PICTURE TODD AND  TEDD OWN SOME SHARES IN CERTAIN MEDIA STOCKS BUT I AM NO VICTIM  OF THIS MYSELF AND THE SELL OFF DID NOT ENTICE ME. SORKIN: HEY WARREN SPEAKING OF BUYBACKS ONE OF THE  QUESTIONS AND I DON\\'T THINK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS SINCE YOU  SENT YOUR LETTER AND WE HAD YOU ON THE SHOW BUT LARRY FINK FROM  BLACKROCK SENT A LETTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO TO CEOS AROUND THE  COUNTRY AND SAID LOOK STOP WITH THE BUYBACKS, STOP WITH THE  DIVIDENDS WE WANT YOU INVESTING IN THE FUTURE AND IN PART I WOULD  ARGUE THAT LETTER SEEMED TO INSPIRE HILLARY CLINTON WITH HER  LATEST QUARTERLY CAPITALISM APPROACH AND PROGRAM THAT SHE\\'S TALK  ABOUT IN TERMS OF CHANGING THE TAX STRUCTURE CAPITAL GAINS  STRUCTURE AROUND INVESTMENTS.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT  HILLARY CLINTON HAD TO SAY AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT LARRY  FINK HAD TO SAY? BUFFETT: WELL PEOPLE MAKE BUYBACKS VERY COMPLICATED.    BUYBACKS MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU ARE BUYING YOUR STOCK BACK  BELOW ITS INTRINSIC VALUE AND WHEN YOU DON\\'T NEED THAT MONEY FOR  THE NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS.  IT MAKES NO SENSE WHEN YOU PAY  ABOVE INTRINSIC VALUE AND THAT\\'S A VERY SIMPLE PRINCIPAL BUT IT  HAS BEEN IGNORED BY MANY MANAGEMENTS OVER TIME.  IF YOU LOOK  AT THE HISTORY OF BUYBACKS PEOPLE BUYBACK A LOT IN TERMS OF  AGRIGATE BUYBACKS PEOPLE BUY A LOT MORE STOCK BACK WHEN STOCKS  ARE UP THAN WHEN THEY ARE DOWN BUT IN THAT WAY THEY ARE SORT OF  BEHAVING LIKE JOE PUBLIC YOU KNOW.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME  GREAT INVESTMENT STORIES BASED ON PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT BACK STOCK  INTELLIGENTLY WHICH MEANS BUYING IT AT A DISCOUNT FROM ITS  INTRINSIC VALUE.  WE WOULD BUY BACK STOCK BY THE BUSHELL  BASKETS IF IT SOLD WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE  WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE AND WE WON\\'T BUY A SHARE IF WE   THINK WE ARE PAYING INTRINSIC VALUE OR MORE. IT IS NOT A  COMPLICATED EQUATION BUT MANAGEMENTS WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS THEY ARE  GOING TO HAVEA 5 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK THEY OUGHT TO SAY WE ARE  HAVING A 5 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK IF WE CAN BUY IT AT X OR BELOW  BUT THAT\\'S JUST NOT THE WAY IT OPERATES. SULLIVAN:  HAS IT BEEN AN EFFICIENT USE OF  CAPITAL BUFFETT: IT HAS BEEN A TERRIFICLY EFFICIENT USE OF CAPITAL  FOR SOME COMPANIES AND BEEN A VERY STUPID USE OF CAPITAL FOR  OTHER COMPANIES.  I WOULD ARGUE THAT OUR BUYBACKS HAVE BEEN  PEANUTS UNFORTUNATELY  BUT OUR COUPLE OF BUYBACKS MADE GREAT  SENSE.  BUT WE COULDN\\'T DO IT ON SCALE.  SORKIN: AND WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HILLARY CLINTONS PROPOSAL  ON CAPITAL GAINS BUT SHE ALSO SAID I BELIEVE THAT SHE WANTS  PEOPLE TO LOOK INTO BUYBACKS THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY  SHOULD BE REGULATED.  ELIZABETH WARREN  AND OTHERS HAVE  SUGGESTED THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY INSIDER TRADING BECAUSE THE  COMPANIES KNOW ABOUT IT. BUFFETT: WELL I WILL BE GLAD TO WRITE A PAPER ON IT  SOMETIME.  I HAVE WRITTEN ON IT ABOUT 20 TIMES OVER THE  YEARS AND IN GENERAL VERY MUCH APPROVE OF WHERE HILLARY IS GOING  IN TERMS OF FINE TUNING ALL THE POINTS WE\\'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AS  THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSES.  BUT BUYBACKS ARE NOT NIRVANA AND  THEY ARE NOT EVIL IT IS JUST A QUESTION OR WHETHER THEY MAKE  SENSE AND IF OUR STOCK SELLS WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE AND WE  HAVE MONEY WE DON\\'T NEED FOR THE BUSINESS WE WILL BUY IT BACK  JUST AS FAST AS WE CAN NOW UNFORTUNATELY WHENEVER I SAY THAT IT  KEEPS IT FROM HAPPENING. QUICK: WARREN WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE A SUPPORTER OF HILLARY  CLINTON BUT DID YOU WATCH THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL DEBATES THAT  TOOK PLACE LAST WEEK? BUFFETT: I WOULDN\\'T HAVE MISSED IT QUICK: AND WHAT DID YOU THINK? BUFFETT: I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TERRIFIC TELEVISION AND I  THINK THERE\\'S A SMALL CHANCE WITH PROPORTIONAL AWARDING DELEGATES  IN A GREAT MANY OF THE PRIMARIES AND WITH SUPER PACKS ENABLING  PEOPLE TO KEEP GETTING FINANCE WHERE AS OTHERWISE THEY WOULD DROP  OUT FOR LACK OF MONEY IF THEY WEREN\\'T DOING THAT WELL.  I  THINK THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME CHANCE THAT WHEN THEY GO TO THE  REPUBLICAN CONVENTION NO ONE WILL HAVE A MAJORITY GOING IN BUT I  THINK IT WILL BE VERY VERY INTERESTING.  DONALD TRUMP IS  GOING TO HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF DELEGATES AND SO WILL A  WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHERS AND IN THE PAST UNLESS YOU WERE IN THE TOP  2 OR 3 YOUR FUNDING DRIES UP AND YOU GET TO A COUPLE OF STATES  AND THAT WAS WITH BUT WITH SUPER PACKS AROUND YOU CAN HAVE QUITE  A FEW CANDIDATES IN IT FOR QUITE A BIT OF TIME AND THE PIE COULD  GET DIVIDED IN SUCH A WAY THAT NOBODY HAS A MAJORITY.  IT IS  GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING.  IT IS A GREAT SPECTATOR  SPORT. QUICK: WE DID HAVE AN OVERNIGHT POLL AN NBC NEWS POLL THAT  WAS CONDUCTED FROM FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY IT SHOWED THAT DONALD  TRUMP IS STILL LEADING THE PACK WHICH MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE TO  SOME PUNDITS WHO HAD KIND OF WRITTEN HIM OFF AFTER THAT  PERFORMANCE. BUFFETT: YEH NO HE IF YOU CAN GET BY THE JOHN MCCAIN IS NOT  A HERO AND A FEW THINGS AND NOT HAVE YOUR NUMBERS GO DOWN YOU  HAVE A VERY SOLID BASE AND YOU KNOW I WOULDN\\'T BE SURPRISED IF HE  MAINTAINS QUITE A SOLID BASE FOR A LONG TIME. AND THAT MEANS HE  IS GOING TO GET A FAIR NUMBER OF DELEGATES IF YOU GET IT IN  PROPORTIONAL STATES. AND HE IS NOT GOING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY SO  IT IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE A  DEMOCRAT.  QUICK: I WAS GOING TO SAY AS A DEMOCRAT YOU MUST ENJOY HOW  THIS PLAYS OUT.  WHO WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO SEE YOUR  CANDIDATE RUN AGAINST? BUFFETT: WELL I THINK IF I GAVE THAT PREDICTION IT WOULD BE  SORT OF THE KISS OF DEATH ON THAT CANDIDATE.  I WANT TO SEE  HER RUN AGAINST THE WHOLE FIELD.  QUICK: YOU KNOW WARREN WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER  THINGS WE WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WE SAW THE JOBS NUMBER  THAT CAME IN.

YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD  IDEA OF WHAT\\'S HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY JUST BASED ON THE NUMBERS  THAT YOU SEE AND THE BUSINESSES THAT YOU HAVE YOUR FINGER ON THE  PULSE.  WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY.   WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FED SHOULD DO IN SPETEMBER? BUFFETT: I THINK WHAT\\'S HAPPENING WITH THE ECONOMY IS  EXACTLY WHAT\\'S BEEN HAPPENING NOW FOR FIVE YEARS IS THAT IT IS  MOVING AHEAD ROUGHLY AT 2% RATE AND IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES A SPURT  OCCASSIONALLY AUTOS ARE STRONG RIGHT NOW BUT IT HAS BEEN A VERY  STEADY INCREASE AND PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT DOUBLE DIPS AND  THEY\\'VE TALKED ABOUT ACCELERATION AND EVERY TIME THEY TALK ABOUT  IT MOVING SHARPLY IN ONE DIRECTION IT DOESN\\'T DO IT.   THE  ECONOMY HAS COME BACK AND IT HAS COME BACK VERY WELL  CONSIDERING THE KIND OF SHOCK THAT WE HAD 5 OR 6 YEARS AGO BUT I  DON\\'T SEE IT PARTICULARLY ACCELERATING AND I DON\\'T SEE IT  DECELERATING EITHER.  I HAVE SAID BEFORE I THINK IT IS VERY  TOUGH TO PUSH RATES HIGHER IN THE U.S. WHEN EUROPE NEEDS TO KEEP  THEM ALL AND YOU\\'VE GOT THE SITUATION EXISTING AROUND THE WORLD  BUT I KEEP HEARING THE VARIOUS GOVERNORS SAY IT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN SOON SO BUT I DON\\'T THINK IT IS AN EASY DECISION WHEN  RATES ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER IN EUROPE AND YOU MAY BE AFFECTING  EXPORTS AND IMPORTS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IF YOU PUSH RATES HERE TO  BE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THEY EXIST IN EUROPE. QUICK: THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN  CONCERNED ABOUT THE MARKET LATELY IF YOU HAVE WATCHED WHAT HAS  BEEN HAPPENING DURING EARNINGS SEASON SOME OF THE MOVES HAVE BEEN  EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE PEOPLE MISSING BY SMALL AMOUNTS ON EARNINGS  OR REVENUE LINES AND THEN COMING IN WITH DOUBLE DIGIT STOCK  DECLINES YOU ALSO SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH MEDIA STOCKS OVERALL  MOVE THE ENTIRE SECTOR LOWER THAT HAS SOME PEOPLE THINKING THAT  THERE IS A LOT OF WEAKNESS IN THE MARKET AND THAT THERE IS  SOMETHING OF A CORRECTION THAT\\'S DUE.  I AM GUESSING THAT I  WOULDN\\'T PUT YOU IN THAT CAMP IF YOU ARE WILLING TO DO DEALS LIKE  THIS OR DO YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ON A DAY TO DAY  BASIS? BUFFETT: STOCKS ARE GOING TO BE HIGHER AND PERHAPS A LOT  HIGHER 10 YEARS FROM NOW, 20 YEARS FROM NOW I AM NOT SMART ENOUGH  TO PICK TIMES TO GET IN AND GET OUT IF YOU ARE IN SOMETHING THAT  IS GOING TO BE A LOT HIGHER OVER TIME.  IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR  HOUSE WAS GOING TO GO DOWN 5% IN PRICE YOU WOULDN\\'T SELL YOUR  HOUSE AND HOPE TO BUY IT BACK 5% CHEAPER.  THAT\\'S NOT MY  GAME.  MY GAME IS TO OWN DECENT BUSINESSES AND OWN THEM AT  DECENT PRICES AND YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OVER TIME  IF YOU DO IT BUT I THINK THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO DANCE IN AND  OUT OF MARKETS IS QUITE LIMITED AND IN MY CASE IT IS  ZERO.  QUICK:  WARREN THERE IS A STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF  THE NEW YORK TIMES TODAY ABOUT COCA COLA WHICH IS A COMPANY THAT  YOU ALSO THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER IN IT POINTS OUT THAT COCA COLA  HAS TEAMED UP WITH SOME INFLUENTIAL SCIENTISTS TO TRY AND ADVANCE  A MESSAGE IN MEDICAL JOURNALS  THAT IT IS REALLY MORE ABOUT  HOW MUCH YOU EXERCISE NOT WHAT YOU EAT THAT MATTERS.  THE  TIMES ACTUALLY KIND OF PUTS THIS AS SOMETHING WHERE THEY LOOK   ASKANCE THE IDEA THAT BIG COPORATION IS FUNDING A MESSAGE  LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU SAY AS THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER? BUFFETT:  WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR WEIGHT DEPENDS ON HOW  MUCH YOU TAKE IN AND HOW MUCH YOU BURN UP.  AND IF YOU TAKE  IN 2700 CALORIES AND YOU BURN UP 2700 YOUR WEIGHT ISN\\'T GOING TO  CHANGE AND IF YOU TAKE IN 3500 AND BURN 2500 YOU ARE GOING TO  GAIN WEIGHT.  IT\\'S A MATHEMATICAL TYPE EQUATION AND IF YOU  ARE LIKE ME AND DON\\'T LIKE TO EXERCISE MUCH THAN YOU BETTER NOT  TAKE IN TOO MUCH.  THERE IS NO MYSTERY TO WEIGHT.   CALORIES ARE DEFINED THERE\\'S 4 PER GRAM IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH  PROTEIN AND CARBOHYDRATES THERE\\'S 9 PER GRAM WITH FAT AND YOU\\'VE  GOT TO FIGURE IT OUT IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT SO YOUR BODY  BURNS OFF AS MANY AS YOU ARE CONSUMING.

              "       'As the White House descends further into chaos, no one can discern President Donald Trump\\'s next move until he makes it.But Trump and administration aides have signaled that he views a presidential declaration of emergency as an exit ramp from the standoff with Congress that has shut down a large chunk of the government for 18 days now. It would, simultaneously, let him assent to reopening federal agencies and assert unilateral authority to order construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Bracing for Trump\\'s decision, congressional aides in both parties say the potential scope of presidential action ranges from very big to very small.A president\\'s authority to declare a national emergency gives him the power to redirect taxpayer funds Congress has already approved. In conversations with lawmakers, the White House has pointed toward two different pots of Pentagon money. One, containing less than $1 billion, is for curtailing drug shipments. The other, containing $22 billion, is for military construction projects.The military construction pot might even be enough to pay for whatever barrier Trump wants across the 2,000-mile border, whether constructed of concrete or steel or something else. If Trump goes big, he could announce his intention to do exactly that.Yet the bigger he goes, the bigger the backlash he risks.An emergency declaration related to border control would face immediate legal challenges, just as his attempt to ban travel into the United States from some majority-Muslim countries did. The more miles of wall Trump attempts to build under an emergency declaration, the more potential challengers — Congress, private landowners, affected local governments.Moreover, a recent 17-page report to Congress shows that the pot of military construction money contains funds previously designated for projects across the country. That would ensure resistance from both red and blue states eager for those projects. And at a time when Trump speaks openly about the prospect of impeachment proceedings, the weak factual basis for a border emergency claim would invite House Democrats to assert an unconstitutional abuse of executive power.But a little-noticed administration maneuver last fall points to a far more limited possibility.It could be completed by only touching the small pot of anti-drug money. It wouldn\\'t require diverting cash from military construction projects elsewhere. It would only affect 31 miles of the Mexican border on a federal explosives-testing site in Arizona.Last fall, the Pentagon informed Congress that the Navy had committed $7.5 million to \"advance planning and survey efforts\" for new and improved border barriers on the Barry M. Goldwater Range. Calling the range \"a known drug-smuggling corridor,\" Assistant Defense Secretary Kenneth Rapuano wrote that such barriers \"will both protect BMGR from such illegal activity and address human life and safety concerns by deterring unlawful entry onto an active bombing range.\"In an October letter to Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, who now chairs the House Armed Services Committee, Rapuano said no construction had occurred on the range. But he noted that the administration was \"reviewing its authority and funding options.\"Expressing strong opposition, Smith and his Democratic colleagues estimated that the 31 miles\\' worth of barrier along the range would cost $450 million. The anti-drug account that the Pentagon might try to tap contains $760 million, according to a Republican congressional aide.Trump has the opportunity to clarify his intentions in a televised prime-time address on the issue Tuesday. If recent form holds, lawmakers will find out at the same time everyone else does.',\n",
              "       'Acting IMF Managing Director David Lipton, in a veiled appeal Thursday on CNBC, called on the U.S. and China to come to an agreement and end their yearlong trade war.Lipton told \"Squawk on the Street\" that the global economic slowdown has been \"certainly affected by the trade tensions,\" though he did not mention the U.S. or China by name.The latest round of trade talks between the world\\'s two biggest economies on Tuesday and Wednesday in Shanghai made little progress. Negotiations are set to resume in September in Washington.Tensions between the White House and Chinese technology giants may also be contributing to the global economic slowdown, Lipton said.\"It\\'s time for the countries to have dialogue, to reach agreements, to try to find a way through this, since the global economy is fragile,\" he said.Global trade has been lower in the first six months of this year compared with the same period in 2018, Lipton said, adding that it\\'s a \"time for vigilance.\"\"Global trade is actually contracting, and that is not a good situation,\" he warned.Lipton said that if a global recession were to start, central banks, including the Federal Reserve, would be in weakened positions to fight it because of all the easy monetary policies.Case in point, the Fed lowered interest rates by 0.25% on Wednesday.Lipton moved into the acting director role after Christine Lagarde resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund.

              "       'It is too soon to declare turmoil in financial markets over and while the U.S. economy should gradually recover, this outlook faces big risks, a top Federal Reserve policy-maker said Monday. \"Although conditions have improved on some fronts, I don\\'t feel we can yet \"breathe easy.\" The path of the economy is still enveloped in considerable uncertainty, and serious risks remain,\" Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said in prepared remarks. A copy of his speech to a luncheon event for the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce was made available to the media prior to delivery. Lockhart is not a voting member of the Fed\\'s interest-rate setting committee this year. The Fed has slashed interest rates by 3.25 percentage points since last September to shield the economy from a global credit crunch. That squeeze was sparked by a U.S. housing crisis that has chilled growth and threatened to tip the economy into recession. But Lockhart signaled he was optimistic that the country would escape this fate. \"On balance, I\\'m expecting a weak first half followed by some improvement in the second half as the drags on growth I mentioned earlier gradually diminish,\" he said. But Lockhart also stressed that he was still concerned by the threat of renewed financial instability undermining growth. \"We remain in a period of considerable uncertainty. There are very real risks to this outlook,\" he said. He said an oil price shock, further upsets in financial markets and a more severe-than-expected downturn in housing could all upset his forecast for U.S. growth to pick up somewhat in the second half of 2008. Lockhart also said inflation was elevated \"with hints of rising inflation expectations,\" but said it should abate as energy and food prices moderate and a softer economy limits the ability of firms to pass on higher prices to customers. \"My base case for inflation assumes a fall-off from the current elevated level of inflation supported by some moderation of energy and food price increases,\" Lockhart said. \"I also expect soft economic growth to constrain the ability of businesses to pass through energy and other costs and raise prices in the coming months,\" he added.',\n",

              "       'Ping An Insurance, China\\'s No. 2 insurer, said on Friday it was not concerned about a plan by Britain\\'s Prudential to buy the Asia assets of U.S. insurer AIG, the market leader among foreign insurers in China.Ping An does not believe Prudential\\'s acquisition of AIG\\'s Asia unit, AIA, would change China\\'s insurance landscape, said Chairman Ma Mingzhe, speaking on the sidelines of the opening of the National People\\'s Congress in Beijing. \"I believe domestic insurers are very competitive in China and we know our market very well,\" said Ma of Ping An, partly owned by HSBC Holdings Plc \"I think foreign insurers will still have much to learn in China,\" he added.In what is the insurance industry\\'s biggest acquisition, Prudential is buying American International Assurance in a big bet on soaring demand in Asia for personal financial services. AIA is regarded as AIG\\'s crown jewel because of its size, cash generation and presence in fast-growth Asia.Ma said Ping An was not interested in teaming with Prudential for the bid, amid some market expectations that Prudential may seek partners such as Asian sovereign funds and cash-rich large Chinese enterprises to help in its $35.5 billion acquisition plan due to the deal\\'s size.Ma\\'s commments were in line with his counterpart Yang Chao, chairman of Ping An\\'s bigger rival China Life who said the country\\'s No.1 insurer was not considering involvement in the Prudential-AIG deal.\"Purely from the financial perspective, I think we can afford to do deals like that, but we are not considering it and Prudential didn\\'t talk to us either,\" Yang told reporters in Beijing.China Life was in talks to invest in AIA last year or to subscribe part of AIA\\'s originally planned initial public offering of shares in Hong Kong but the talks failed to move forward, Chinese media reported.China LegacyPing An\\'s Ma, whose firm made huge losses from a wrong bet on its investments in Europe\\'s Fortis amid the financial crisis, said he believed that domestic firms would continue to dominate China\\'s insurance market for at least the next five to 10 years.While AIG can trace its Asian roots back to 1919, when Cornelius Vander Starr started a small insurance agency in Shanghai, AIA started in China in 1992. AIA in China is 100 percent owned by AIG -- the only wholly-foreign owned insurer with special permission from Beijing to operate in the country.Other foreign insurers have long complained to Beijing about AIA\\'s exclusive ownership status as they seek a bigger share of the country\\'s fast-expanding insurance business.Prudential currently operates CITIC-Prudential Insurance Co in China, a 50-50 joint venture in China with CITIC Group, China\\'s biggest financial conglomerate.When asked for comments on the future of AIA\\'s ownership status in China, Ma replied: \"I think this will be a problem for Prudential to deal with.\"Ma also noted Ping An would not be interested in AIA\\'s China assets even if they were put up for sale.AIA collected 8 billion yuan ($1.17 billion) in premiums in 2009, accounting for 18.9 percent market share among Sino-foreign joint-venture life insurers in China, or nearly 1 percent of total market share, according to official data.China\\'s top three insurers -- China Life, Ping An and China Pacific Insurance partly owned by the Carlyle Group -- currently control a combined over 50 percent share of China\\'s life insurance market.',\n",
              "       'WASHINGTON -- Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney is promising to get tough on China to help American workers, but his plans could backfire.Romney is pledging, on his first day in office, to designate China a currency manipulator, a step no administration has taken against any country for 18 years.That could, eventually, lead to tariffs punishing China for policies that Americans believe unfairly keep Chinese products cheap, hurting U.S. manufacturers. Tariffs could trigger a trade war with a country that is the fastest-growing market for U.S. exports. Even if they don\\'t, the designation would instantly set back relations with Asia\\'s emerging superpower.The U.S. seeks Chinese cooperation on international hot spots, such as North Korea and Iran, and wants to narrow differences over how to handle maritime territorial disputes in East Asia.Given the potential repercussions, some foreign policy experts doubt Romney would carry out the currency threat. Other presidential candidates have made similar promises in order to appeal to voters who have seen manufacturing jobs migrate to China. But, once elected, they soften their approach.\"There\\'s probably been wisdom in administrations in the past, Republican and Democrat, of not wanting to go there,\" said Jon Huntsman, who served as President Barack Obama\\'s first ambassador to China before a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination.But the commitment to act on Inauguration Day doesn\\'t appear to leave much room to back down.Romney has also taken aim at Obama\\'s \"pivot\" to Asia _ a strategy of deploying more forces and shoring up U.S. alliances there, in part to counter China\\'s military buildup.In a speech this week, Romney said China\\'s recent assertiveness was \"sending chills through the region.\" He said the pivot is under-resourced and has alienated U.S. allies elsewhere. He outlined plans to expand U.S. naval power _ although it\\'s unclear how he\\'d pay for it since he also wants to slash government spending.\"What we have seen from the Obama administration has been acquiescence to China, not just on trade issues and currency issues, but on issues of security and human rights,\" said Romney foreign policy adviser Alex Wong. \"To protect our interests and those of our small businesses and of our economy, we have to take measures to make sure China does play by the rules.\"U.S.-Chinese relations are entering a critical juncture. Two days after the Nov. 6 vote, China will begin its own once-in-a-decade leadership transition. How the next U.S. administration gets on with the new guard in Beijing could determine whether the world\\'s pre-eminent military powers can cooperate in the Asia-Pacific region or head on a path to confrontation.Appreciation of those stakes tends to get lost in the fiercely fought election campaign.Both Romney and Obama have TV spots with China as a foil. Romney accuses Obama of being soft on China\\'s trade practices; Obama accuses Romney of outsourcing U.S. jobs to China when he ran the private equity firm Bain Capital.The tone of the debate, labeling China a \"cheat,\" has drawn withering criticism from the architect of U.S. re-engagement with Beijing 40 years ago, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who has nonetheless endorsed Romney. Kissinger said that avoiding conflict between the powers is the most fundamental challenge for U.S. foreign policy.China\\'s state media has weighed in with unusually direct criticism of a presidential candidate, suggesting that Beijing hopes Obama will win.News agency Xinhua has accused Romney of hypocrisy, saying much of his wealth was made doing business with Chinese companies and warning that his \"mudslinging\" policies could spark a trade war.Early in his presidency, Obama made warmer relations with China a priority, and ties have deepened. The two governments have navigated some rough patches _ such as the standoff over a blind activist, Chen Guangcheng, who sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and was then allowed to come to the U.S. to study. The Obama administration said that reflected a maturing relationship.But diplomacy has failed to bridge fundamental differences on issues such as climate change, the civil war in Syria and China\\'s territorial disputes with its neighbors. And as the U.S. has wound down its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, its modest moves to deploy more forces around Asia have irritated Beijing.Romney is calling for an even stronger U.S. presence in the Pacific. Wong said that would encourage the peaceful resolution of the region\\'s many maritime territorial disputes, including one flaring between U.S. ally Japan and China over islands both claim. He said Romney would make clear it has a treaty alliance with Japan that covers the islands and has the naval power to back it up.Those plans, though, could take years to implement. Addressing the currency issue on Day One would immediately affect relations.Romney says he would designate China as a manipulator unless it stops currency manipulation by his January inauguration. Romney trade policy adviser Oren Cass said this would set a new tone and show the U.S. is willing to take China to task over a range of trade violations, including intellectual property theft and restrictions on market access for U.S. companies in China.The designation itself would not mandate any sanctions, but would require that the U.S. hold consultations with China.Cass said that if Beijing doesn\\'t move toward changing its currency policies after consultations, the U.S. could impose so-called countervailing duties on Chinese products.But Matthew Goodman, former director of international economics in the National Security Council under Obama, said the U.S. discretion to unilaterally impose retaliatory tariffs ended when it joined the World Trade Organization in 1995, and in practice it is difficult to take a currency dispute to the WTO for settlement. Cass says that under domestic law, the U.S. could impose countervailing duties, and it\\'s an open legal question at the WTO whether member states can do so unilaterally to compensate for a currency subsidy.How China would respond may be swayed by its leadership transition. The new guard would not want to appear weak. But neither would China want the dispute to escalate as it relies on exports and faces its own economic slowdown. If that translates into major job losses at home it could affect social stability, which is Beijing\\'s biggest concern.Obama has consistently opted against designation of China as a currency manipulator. Like President George W. Bush before him, he has preferred to wait while economic forces encourage Beijing to allow its currency to strengthen _ which it has done, although most economists still believe it is undervalued.The Treasury is due to make its next six-month assessment on Monday, although it\\'s not yet clear if it will be announced on that date. China is likely to get a pass.',\n",

Markit\\'s flash purchasing managers\\' index (PMI) for April  revealed that the euro zone\\'s composite index rose to 54.0, up  from 53.1 in March. A reading above 50 marks an expansion in the  private sector.  The data was driven by strong growth in Germany, with the  composite number rising to 56.3 in April, from 54.3 in March.  France saw slower growth in its private sector, but output rose  for a second month with a figure of 50.5, down from March\\'s 51.8  reading. Output in the euro zone\\'s second-largest economy was hit  by new orders in manufacturing, which stagnated after rising in  March. This caused French firms to once again cut back on their  staffing levels, according to Markit, the London-based research  company that collates the data.  The data provided proof that French growth was still \"fragile\", according to Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. This was in marked contrast to the \"robust\" expansion he suggested the German numbers indicated. Markit Tweet  The single currency rose to a session high of $1.3843 shortly  after the data release. The euro had started the session at $1.3806. European stock markets showed little change with earnings  release in the tech sector continuing to weigh on investor  sentiment.  Despite the softer data from France, the private sector in the  euro area grew at its fastest in just under three years in April,  with the bloc as a whole showing signs of a return to job  creation.  \"With backlogs of work rising, albeit only modestly, firms took  on more staff in order to expand capacity. The increase in  employment was the largest since September 2011, and only the  second since 2011.

              "       \"As 2015 comes to a close, eight debates have given us an opportunity to learn where the top-tier candidates on both sides of the aisle stand on the economic issues that matter most to working families — child care, minimum wage, equal pay and paid family leave. We got useful insights into which candidates support working families — and which ones are ignoring them.  Child care, one of the biggest issues facing Americans today, has received almost no attention. The first five years of a child's life are critical for learning social and emotional skills, as well as for setting them up to be good students and citizens later in life. Once children start school, they often need to attend after-school programs while their parents work. Wondering how to afford safe educational environments for our kids keeps parents up at night.     According to our recent polling, affordable child care is one of the key issues voters say would sway them to vote for a candidate. Yet, it has only come up three times during the debates — once when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mentioned her support for early childhood education in an answer (before being cut off by the moderator), once when Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders  talked about how his wife, as first lady, could help him address the dysfunctional child care system in the U.S., and once when Florida Senator Marco Rubio was asked about his child tax credit plan. Rubio said that in many states child care costs more than college, and families don't know how they will make their payments every month, let alone save for college. Yet his $2,500 child tax plan is a drop in the bucket compared to the more than $12,000 a year families pay for care for their four-year olds in some states. And it does nothing to support the people who care for our little ones, who are paid, on average, $10.30 an hour. Even Rubio has acknowledged that $10 an hour is not enough to live on.    Child care should be a huge issue for the presidential candidates.  Another issue that would impact the economic security of women and families (and their votes) is the minimum wage. One of the clearest distinctions to come out of the presidential debates has been the Democratic candidates' support for, and the Republican  candidates' opposition to, raising the federal minimum wage. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Raising it would disproportionately benefit women, who are two-thirds of the country's minimum wage earners, and would help millions of families make ends meet.  Sanders and Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley support an increase to $15 per hour and Clinton supports an increase to $12 per hour nationally, as well as $15 per hour in certain areas. Meanwhile, the debates revealed that Donald Trump, Ben Carson  and Rubio are strongly opposed to a minimum wage increase. With women currently paid on average 79 cents for every dollar paid to men, a minimum wage increase is a big deal not just for helping families stay afloat, but also for getting closer to equal pay for women and men.   Consistent with their support for an increase in the federal minimum wage, Sanders and Clinton have been proactive about their support for equal pay for equal work, and Clinton has specifically called for pay transparency and the Paycheck Fairness Act. These policies help address the fact that if women don't know they are being paid differently, it's impossible to fix the problem. Yet, on the GOP side, Texas Senator Ted Ted Cruz and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina avoided answering a question about the problem of unequal pay, pivoting instead to a conversation about single moms and rising poverty among women (yet without saying what they would do about it).    On paid family and medical leave, all three Democratic candidates used the debates to express their strong support for it, noting that the United States is one of the only nations in the world without it. In states that have adopted a paid family and medical leave policy, employers and employees alike report benefiting from it. Yet, the Republican debates have been silent on the issue.     In fact, the Republican debates have largely ignored all of the issues that would truly support working families — and only revealed how out of touch the candidates are with the realities of today's workforce. As just one example, take the final Republican debate of the year, when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, ostensibly one of the most moderate candidates of the batch, talked about about moms dropping off kids at the bus stop while dads went to work. As we end 2015, moms are actually breadwinners in two-thirds of families in the United States. Candidates with outdated views like Christie's share a lack of vision for updating our workplace rules to match today's realities.      In 2016, candidates have the opportunity to get even more specific about what they will do to make sure no one has to choose between being there for family and earning a living. Instead of using hate and fear-based rhetoric that stokes anxiety and unrest, candidates should focus on how they will improve the quality of life for the millions of working families in the U.S. The best way to do this: share their visions for national economic solutions that will help us all, together, make it work.

Explain your business model and exactly how you make money. This includes addressing pricing, costs, and margins. Your investors need to understand the economics of solving this problem or serving a need.  2. Explain why YOU are the best team to make this happen. Investors want to know your background and areas of expertise. We need to understand why we would bet on you vs. any other players in the space. 3. Address your competitive edge. That can include intellectual property, patent protection, and exclusive relationships. We need to understand what prevents others from replicating what you\\'re doing. 4. Talk about your long-term vision for the company. This includes growth plans for future products and geographic markets. If you\\'re raising money, we also need to know the terms and your \"exit strategy\" for return on capital. 5. Explain how your business scales. We want to know that this is more than just a niche opportunity. Describe how you would grow across a large customer base in various geographies while making the most of limited resources. And explain what your sales and marketing plan is for acquiring customers.   1. Launch into a long story before you say what you do. So don\\'t start by talking about the customer\\'s problem, the market, or your team. If you don\\'t tell us what you do first, you\\'ve already lost our attention. 2. Forget to address any relevant legal issues and risks. We would never want to be blindsided by a government action or customer lawsuit. Help us understand the potential risks and how you\\'re addressing them. 3. Stretch the truth! Be honest and authentic. Support your claims with facts, research, and data, and independently measure your results. If something sounds too good to be true to us, we know it probably is! 4. Forget to address seasonality or cyclicality of your product or industry. We need to understandthe volatility of sales and customer behavior so that we aren\\'t surprised byunexpected changes in results.  5. Forget to show passion and deliver a great presentation! It\\'s all about the entrepreneur after all, and we want to believe in you! Ideas are a dime a dozen, but a dynamic entrepreneur who knows how to execute is pure gold!

A quick look at a 30-day chart might confuse unknowing investors, so it’s important to be clear.So what happened? Allscripts has new ownership. Mysis PLC, which trades on the London exchange, merged its Mysis Healthcare Systems division with Allscripts and, for an addition $330 million, took at 54.5% stake in the company. The dividend merger was a payout of this merger. But the newly combined companies have a “shared vision,” Tullman said, and investors shouldn’t be worried about integration problems. So Allscripts, on top of the $70 million already invested in research and development and the one out of three doctors who use the company’s e-prescribing software, now has a better base to sell into and that should accelerate growth over time.But why not just keep that money instead of paying that dividend?“We like to take care of our shareholders,” Tullman said, “and we have what we need to grow today.”Cramer is bullish on Allscripts, a stock he called “a pure Barack Obama play” because the company fits into the Democrat’s plans to cut healthcare costs.Questions for Cramer?

              "       'The strike that crippled two of the nation\\'s busiest shipping  ports was settled this week, but the trend it spotlighted —  the offshoring of service jobs — is expected to continue to  grow across the USA.  The eight-day walkout by clerical workers at the ports of Los  Angeles and Long Beach largely centered on the outsourcing of  their jobs overseas and to elsewhere in the U.S., says Craig  Merrilees, a spokesman for the International Longshore and  Warehouse Union. Shippers denied outsourcing jobs, but the  tentative settlement restricts the practice, according to the  Associated Press.Service companies have been sending jobs abroad in large  numbers the past decade to cut labor costs — a trend that  accelerated in the recession and is expected to continue the next  few years before slowing after 2016. About 663,000 large-company  jobs in information technology, human resources, finance and  purchasing — the category that includes the port workers  — have been offshored since 2002, according to The Hackett  Group.  By 2016, the consulting firm estimates, another 375,000 jobs in  the sectors will be moved abroad. More than a third of the U.S.  jobs in those industries in 2002 will have moved offshore by  2016.  Most workers are employed directly by companies that previously  used U.S. staffers, though some work for outsourcing firms.  Hackett studied companies with at least $1 billion in annual  revenue, noting they represent about 75% of the offshoring  market.  India is the largest offshoring center. Service jobs also have  gone to eastern Europe, the Philippines, China and Mexico.(Read More: How Immigrants Are Changing U.S. Businesses)  In other sectors, initially low-level jobs were offshored, such  as handling payroll or tracking purchase orders. Employers  typically can cut labor costs by about 75 percent, Dorr says. In recent  years, a growing number of higher-level jobs have moved overseas,  such as benefits analysis and vendor management, though the cost  savings for offshoring those positions is only about 25 percent.The  trend took off after companies began contracting with programmers  in India to help with the massive preparations for the Y2K  computer bug in 2000, says Hackett research director Erik Dorr.  \"Organizations now feel more comfortable moving up the value  chain,\" Dorr says, noting, for example, that India\\'s education  system is improving and turning out top-notch job candidates.  Since 2005, legal services such as document review, contract  drafting and regulatory communication increasingly have been  offshored, particularly to India, says Greg McPolin, managing  director of Pangea3, a legal outsourcing firm. Indian attorneys  handle work that in the U.S. is sometimes done by paralegals and  at a 40 to 60 percent cost savings, he says.  Several thousand legal jobs have been offshored, estimates Edward  Brooks, founder of The LPO Program, a legal consulting firm.  \"In the current environment, it is more important than ever that  … the support we provide to clients adds value without  adding unnecessary cost,\" law firm Clifford Chance said in a  statement.  Once services are offshored, there\\'s little chance they\\'ll come  back to the U.S., Dorr says. By contrast, manufacturers have  returned some production to the U.S. recently, largely because of  a narrowing wage gap between the U.S. and China, rising shipping  costs and falling U.S. energy costs — factors that generally  haven\\'t affected service jobs.  One exception: call-centers. About 500,000 of these jobs were offshored  from 2006 to 2010, according to the Communications Workers of  America.

              "       \"* Foreign oil tankers help ease supply crunch in US Northeast* Little focus on better-than-expected US jobs data for Oct* Oil prices lose 2 pct on the day; Brent down 4 pct* Gold hits 2-month low; copper ends down for 4th week* Cocoa rallies on Ghana supply squeeze, bucking weak trendNEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled on Friday as foreign tankers were allowed to bring fuel from U.S. ports to the Northeast to ease a supply crunch after Hurricane Sandy, and metals and other key commodities fell on worries the devastation from the storm could hamper the economic recovery. The declines wiped out Thursday's gains that came after markets appeared to gain a sense of normalcy following the massive storm earlier this week that killed at least 102 people. Many in the stricken region were still without power, gasoline and information about when their shattered lives might return to normal. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on the day, with U.S. crude settling below $85 a barrel and London's Brent finishing under $106. Brent, which affects global oil prices more than U.S. crude, fell nearly 4 percent on the week. Gasoline futures in New York also fell more than 2 percent, to below $2.58 per gallon, as oil tankers and pipelines supplying New Jersey and the New York Harbor - the delivery point for the U.S. contract - restored more operations that had been roiled by the hurricane. The Thomson Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a bellwether for commodities, fell 1.6 percent after 14 of its 19 components settled in negative territory. The selloff came despite a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report for October which ordinarily would have sent prices rallying. While oil and gasoline fell over 2 percent, natural gas was the CRB's biggest loser for the day. It tumbled 4 percent on milder weather forecasts for the U.S. Northeast next week that reduced the potential demand for gas as a heating fuel. Oil came under pressure after the U.S. government temporarily waived Jones Act restrictions on tankers carrying fuel from the Gulf Coast refining hub to the hard-hit Northeast, increasing the fleet of ships that would normally be confined to domestic vessels and crews. ``I think economic uncertainty and next week's (U.S.) elections are weighing on oil prices. You also have the statement that the Jones Act is going to be waived for a week, suggesting some supplies are going to return,'' said analyst Gene McGillian at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.GOLD AT 2-MONTH LOW, COPPER DOWN U.S. gold futures hit a two-month low below $1,700 an ounce and were down almost 2 percent this week, settling at below $1,682 to mark a fourth consecutive weekly decline. Gold has erased all its gains made after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its latest bond buybacks to boost the job market in September. ``Better-than-expected numbers reduced the risk demand for gold, and a drop below $1,700 an ounce triggered sell-stops and momentum selling,'' said James Steel, metals analyst at HSBC. ``There are also long liquidation ahead of elections triggered by the job number,'' Steel said. Copper prices fell for a fourth consecutive week. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $7,665.50 a tonne in official rings, down 2 percent from Thursday's close of $7,826 a tonne. Corn and soybeans fell about 2 percent each on Midwest harvest projections that suggested both crops may be larger than previously thought.COCOA BUCKS LOWER TREND Cocoa bucked the weakness in other commodities, pushing above technical support levels as some exports faced a holdup and purchases slowed in the main West African growing region. New York-traded cocoa futures closed up $27, or 1.1 percent, at $2,447 per tonne, as traders watched the early progress of main crop harvests in West Africa. The market climbed for a second straight day after hitting its 200-day moving average around $2,352. Cocoa purchases in Ghana, the world's second-biggest producer of the crop, stood at 86,028 tonnes by Oct. 19 in the first week of the season, down 42 percent from the same period a year ago, trade data showed on Thursday. The numbers were lower than expected and were helping to underpin the market, traders said.Prices at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT)\",\n",

In a joint statement, the U.S. Trade Representative\\'s (USTR) office and the U.S. Treasury reiterated their view that China\\'s negotiators had \"backpedaled\" on important elements of a deal that had been largely agreed, including on an enforcement provision.   \"Our insistence on detailed and enforceable commitments from the Chinese in no way constitutes a threat to Chinese sovereignty,\" USTR and the Treasury said. \"Rather, the issues discussed are common to trade agreements and are necessary to address the systemic issues that have contributed to persistent and unsustainable trade deficits.\"   China on Sunday issued a government policy paper on the U.S.-China trade dispute in which it asserted that the United States bore responsibility for setbacks in the talks, citing three instances in which Washington had backtracked on commitments made during the negotiations.  China\\'s Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen, a prominent member of Beijing\\'s negotiating team, said in presenting the paper to the media that it would be impossible for the United States to use \"extreme pressure\" to force concessions from China.   Acrimonious rhetoric between Beijing and Washington has steadily increased since talks broke down in early May over U.S. accusations that Beijing had backtracked on commitments to codify in law changes to its intellectual property and technology transfer practices to address U.S. demands.   President Donald Trump imposed an increase in tariffs to 25% on a $200 billion list of Chinese goods on May 10, saying that China \"broke the deal.\" His administration later imposed severe sanctions against Huawei Technologies Co, China\\'s premier telecommunications equipment firm.  \"The United States is disappointed that the Chinese have chosen in the \\'White Paper\\' issued (on Sunday) and recent public statements to pursue a blame game misrepresenting the nature and history of trade negotiations between the two countries,\" USTR and Treasury said in the statement.   The agencies, which have taken the lead in negotiations for the U.S. side, said that the impetus for the negotiations wasChina\\'s \"long history of unfair trade practices,\" and U.S. negotiating positions have been consistent throughout the talks.

Eight fresh cases of the H7N9 bird flu virus have been reported  in the eastern provinces of China this week, bringing the total  figure of those infected to 82, Reuters reported. China is also  investigating the possibility of human-to-human transmission of  bird flu, a top Chinese health official was quoted as saying on  Thursday.

Those increases were offset by a decline of 9,000 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance.The government and private sector forbearance programs, initiated at the start of the pandemic, allow borrowers to delay their monthly payments for at least three months and for up to a year. Forbearance is granted in three-month terms, and so far more than 75% of borrowers in bailouts are on extensions since March.\"As of the 29th [of September], nearly 800,000 forbearance plans were still set to expire in September, down from 2 million at the start of the month. The data is still coming in, but over the past week, we\\'ve seen a roughly 80% extension rate,\" said Andy Walden, director of market research at Black Knight. \"Given that there are another million plans for which October marks the last payment covered by forbearance, we should expect to see heightened levels of expiration/extension activity in the coming weeks.\"As of Tuesday, roughly 3.6 million homeowners remain in pandemic-related forbearance plans. That\\'s 6.8% of all active mortgages, representing $751 billion in unpaid principal.While the weekly turn is troubling, over the past month active forbearance volumes have fallen by 305,000, or 8%. FHA and VA loans, which generally go to borrowers with lower incomes and lower down payments, are not recovering as well as the rest of the market. It is likely those borrowers are in jobs that have been hardest hit by the pandemic.It is impossible to know specifically why more borrowers suddenly needed help on their mortgages, but it is a sign that all is not improving in the housing market. Some borrowers have been dipping into savings to make their monthly payments, and that may have now run dry. While the economy is adding jobs again, the unemployment rate is still high, and some borrowers are still clearly struggling.\\xa0By loan type, 4.7% of all Fannie and Freddie-backed loans are in forbearance, while 11.2% of all FHA/VA loans are. For private label and bank-held loans, that share is 7.3%.',\n",

              "       'Erica Friedle had not missed a vote in seven years. Then came the coronavirus pandemic.Friedle told CNBC she didn\\'t receive her absentee ballot for April\\'s Wisconsin presidential primary. And now\\xa0she fears that a lack of preparation by state officials and the continued threat of the disease might force her to sit out the upcoming November election in the swing state.\\xa0As health officials predict that the pandemic might last into the fall, many states are beginning to plan for the likelihood of people opting to vote by mail instead of showing up in person, where the risk of contracting and spreading the coronavirus is greater.\\xa0For some people, the coronavirus has made voting a nerve-wracking action. Some Americans and voting rights groups are concerned that the pandemic is forcing voters to choose between avoiding contact with people to stay healthy and exercising their right to vote. Come November, these concerns might linger.\"Are people going to want to stay in line to vote? Are people going to be requesting absentee ballots? Do people even have the technology to request a ballot online?\" Friedle asked, listing out some of her immediate worries in an interview with CNBC. \"There are so many unknowns right now.\"The Wisconsin primary in particular has been criticized for its disorganization and last-minute changes, leading to voter confusion and disenfranchisement\\xa0and serves as an example of what voting rights groups hope will not happen in November.Complicating matters, President Donald Trump and members of the Republican Party are on the attack against widespread mail-in voting while Democrats push for expanded access. Late last month, Trump threatened to withhold funding from Michigan and Nevada for expanding their mail-in voting services in an effort to avoid crowded polling centers during the coronavirus pandemic.\\xa0\"More and more states are allowing vote-by-mail without voters having to provide a reason or excuse for it,\" said Andrea Hailey, CEO of Vote.org, a nonprofit focusing on advancing voter ballot access. \"Other states are mailing applications to voters, which is critical for ensuring that all voters can participate in the electoral process.\"More than half, or 54%, of Americans said they would back voting by mail in the upcoming presidential election if the pandemic persists, according to an April Morning Consult poll. And 66% of surveyed Americans said in March that they were concerned about voting in person during the coronavirus outbreak.\\xa0\"We are seeing signs that voters are registering at numbers unseen from our organization, and that they are very much interested in voting by absentee,\" Hailey told CNBC in an email.But mail-in voting can bring its own concerns, especially if there are underlying circumstances that affect support, such as the potential for\\xa0U.S.\\xa0Postal\\xa0Service operation failure or miscommunication between state officials and voters.Friedle, a second-grade teacher, said she applied for an absentee ballot but did not receive it ahead of the Wisconsin presidential primary on April 7. She is a single mother with a 10-year-old child, sharing custody with her ex-husband, a scientist at a large pharmaceutical company who at the time of the primary had been working on a vaccine for Covid-19.The combination of being unable to leave her child alone and fearing getting sick at the polls made Friedle miss the vote.\\xa0\\xa0\"I didn\\'t want to put myself at risk for getting sick,\" she said. \"I\\'ve been taking care of my daughter the whole time. Her father works crazy hours, and at that time, he was telling me he might get locked out in his work, that he wouldn\\'t be able to leave his work.\"She added: \"That just made me nervous. Who\\'s gonna watch my daughter?\"\\xa0Friedle, 41, is not within the most vulnerable age group for contracting the most severe form of the virus.\\xa0But there\\'s still a lot at stake for people like Friedle: parents with young kids or teachers whose students are relying on them even as online classes persist. Knowing the risks, Friedle chose instead to skip out on voting. She feared if she contracted the virus, she would pass it on to her daughter or potentially be unable to teach.\\xa0Voting rights groups stress that the most susceptible people are \"older voters and people with pre-existing conditions,\" according to Brett Edkins, political director at New York-based Stand Up America, a nonprofit focused on advancing Democratic goals. \"Children and younger parents are at relatively low risk of becoming seriously ill. Election experts across the partisan divide say that mail-in voting is the safest alternative to in-person voting.\"But Friedle\\'s experience during the Wisconsin primary gave her a taste of what November might look like for her and other voters across the nation, she said.\\xa0She\\'s hoping to see her state take action in the coming months to reduce the likelihood of people experiencing what she did. This includes \"having multiple ways to vote, whether you want to vote early, via an absentee ballot or in person.\"At the same time, she\\'s concerned about whether officials are considering the feasibility of these moves. \"How can we do that? How can we do it safely so people aren\\'t being exposed to germs or viruses?\" she asked. \"Lots of organizations are out there that drive people to the polls. Are people still organizing these things with Covid going on?\"In other states, some voters are concerned that there won\\'t be enough done to make in-person voting safer.\\xa0Angel Wells, a frequent voter and a self-described human rights activist based in Arizona, said that\\'s what\\'s driving her fears today.\\xa0Voting can get chaotic in Arizona, said Wells, a veteran. In her voting area, \"there are 64 voting offices where you can cast your vote. But that\\'s not enough when you live in a valley with millions of people.\"\"When people go out to vote, those lines are long. The polling booths are close [together]. They\\'re not six feet apart. How are we supposed to have this vote and keep within health guidelines?\"\\xa0\"People are rightly concerned about having to choose between their right to vote and their health,\" Edkins of Stand Up America said. \"I think we\\'re hearing a lot of those concerns from our community and from voters everywhere.\"',\n",

Apple did not announce many details about the services, including pricing for TV+ and Arcade.

And that prospect is unlikely  to be as alarming for financial markets as feared, analysts tell  CNBC. Fed officials have mapped out a strategy to wind down its $85  billion-a-month bond-buying program in careful steps, although  the timing of when that will start is still being debated, noted  Fed watcher Jon Hilsenrath wrote in the WSJ. Any unwinding of the Fed\\'s quantitative easing (QE) program,  which has fueled a rally in equity markets and other risk assets,  is generally viewed as negative and any indication of this  happening has been highly anticipated in the U.S. since late last  week.

              "       \"UPDATE: The Sara Lee story: it is likely about price and inflationTheDeal.com report that a sale of SLE is unlikely dropped the stock about 4 percent. Reports abound that the Board is meeting today to consider selling pieces of the company, such as the meat or coffee division, or breaking it into separate pieces. The likely problem: inability to agree on a price. Why? Because food companies are in a tough environment, an environment that cannot be easily changed just by getting bigger. The big issue for food companies: inflation. Bernstein, in a recent note to clients, noted that cost of goods sold (COGS) inflation will average 6.7 percent for 2011 for the large food companies like SLE, Kraft , Kellogg  and Campbell's . That is up from a 5 percent estimate that was done in October and way above the 3-5 percent sweet spot preferred by many management teams, they say. Knock-on effects: 1) commodity inflation causes food stocks to underperform because margins get hit 2) when food prices go up, private labels gain market share 3) innovation becomes more important: the ability to raise prices often depends on the ability to introduce new products, rather than renovate existing ones. -----Sara Lee was down as much as 4 percent Thursday on a story in TheDeal.com that a sale of the company appears unlikely, citing unnamed sources. The company  has been widely believed to be a takeover target, or that it might separately sell its meat or beverage businesses. A number of players, including Apollo Global Management and KKR, have reportedly expressed interest in a buyout. Recall that CEO Brenda Barnes stepped down in August for health reasons. Though SLE has many well-known brand names (Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm), it's a tough sell: the food business is highly competitive, and as we have seen in other companies, it is tough to get pricing power. Higher commodity costs, as has been widely reported, add to the uncertainty.More:'Fast Money' Traders: What Commodities Are Saying Now_____________________________Bookmark CNBC Data Pages:__________________________________________________________Want updates whenever a TraderTalk blog is filed?

There\\'s an art museum, an international film festival, a Whole Foods, Thai restaurants, racks for commuters\\' bikes, and the headquarters of Garden State Equality, New Jersey\\'s largest gay-rights group.The population _ 62 percent white, 27 percent black _ is racially integrated and largely well-to-do. The median household income is $140,000.And the idea of tolerance is part of the town\\'s identity. In a scene in \"Mad Men,\" a TV drama set in the 1960s, characters who went to Montclair for a party were stunned to see black and white revelers together _ and marijuana being passed around.Medical marijuana is a dicey business. In the eyes of the federal government, the medicine is still an illegal drug.Some patients say marijuana can ease symptoms associated with conditions ranging from multiple sclerosis to migraines. It has been used to treat pain, nausea and lack of appetite in cancer and AIDS patients.Seventeen states and Washington, D.C., have flouted federal law and passed some sort of statute to allow patients access to the drug.Each state has its own model for how the cannabis can be distributed. Some, like New Jersey _ where advocates lament and some officials brag that the laws are the nation\\'s strictest _ are still in a startup phase.So far, nine states _ Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington _ have dispensaries operating. Some states are still setting up distribution systems, and some use home-grown marijuana or other setups that do not include dispensaries.Chris Goldstein, a spokesman for both the Philadelphia chapter of the pro-pot group NORML and the Coalition for Medical Marijuana of New Jersey, has visited dispensaries all over the country. He said most of the storefront operations look more like the one ready to open in Montclair than those proposed in industrial districts of New Jersey.\"The dispensaries are in the higher-end neighborhoods of California towns. There are people who are wealthy and who are poor who need to access medical marijuana,\" he said. \"In New Jersey, it\\'s wherever the dispensary can get their location.\"New Jersey is not allowing registered patients to grow their own, and is limiting the potency, amount and variety of pot patients can buy. There\\'s a relatively short list of conditions that qualify patients for the drug, and unlike some more lenient states, chronic pain and anxiety aren\\'t on it.Only New Jersey residents are eligible. New York, easily reachable by rail, does not allow medical marijuana, though lawmakers have proposed doing so.Last year, the New Jersey Department of Health selected six nonprofit groups to pursue plans to grow and sell cannabis. The other five have struggled to find towns that will accept them, and none yet has permission to start growing marijuana, let alone sell it.Groups are planning sites in Egg Harbor Township and Woodbridge. The other three groups have not announced their latest location plans.Only Greenleaf has had a direct path. In its application, the group said it would meet patients in Montclair and grow its plants in another, undisclosed town. The group won\\'t say where, citing security.A year ago, Janice Talley, Montclair\\'s director of planning and community development, found that the site on Bloomfield Avenue _ next door to an abortion clinic and three buildings down from an adult video store that has pipes and vaporizers displayed for sale _ would be a permissible for the new business under zoning laws.Talley said she fielded complaints from some national anti-marijuana groups. \"Nobody from the town called me and complained why we had that facility,\" she said. \"It wasn\\'t a huge issue here.\"Behind the counter at Health Love and Soul Juice Bar and Grill a couple doors down from Greenleaf, Jarisi Anderson, said he\\'s all for the new establishment. \"It\\'s a beautiful thing,\" he said.His co-worker, Queen Townsend, fears the place could be a problem, but she believes she\\'s in the minority. \"The people I\\'ve met in Montclair _ I don\\'t want to stereotype _ a lot of people here smoke weed,\" she said. \"They don\\'t have a problem with that.\"The guys smoking tobacco down the street at Fume, a cigar shop, said they aren\\'t troubled by legalizing marijuana _ medicinal or not. \"It\\'s a waste to lock somebody up for a nickel bag or a dime bag,\" said shop owner Ralph Alberto.But the dispensary could give the non-Montclair residents who go there to protest another cause.Last week, Bernadette Grant stood across the street from the dispensary\\'s neighboring abortion clinic with rosary beads in one hand and anti-abortion pamphlets in the other. She said she considers medical marijuana in the same category as abortion.\"This is not pro-life ,\" she said. \"This is pro-death.\"___Follow Mulvihill at http://www.twitter.com/geoffmulvihill',\n",

              "       \"* Upbeat U.S. private payrolls data boosts dollar* Yen hampered by Japan's trade deficit, economic woes* Euro has been hit by Greek court ruling on austerity stepsLONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a near four month-high against the yen on Friday as investors bet on an upbeat U.S. payrolls report after private employers added jobs at the fastest pace in eight months. The euro fell to a three-week low against the dollar on selling by long-term investors. The euro has also been under pressure since a Greek court ruled on Thursday that pension reform demanded by foreign lenders may be unconstitutional. That raised concerns about Athens' ability to implement the austerity measures needed to secure bailout funds. All these drove the dollar index to a seven-week high of 80.389, breaking above its 55-day moving average of 80.14. The dollar was up 0.2 percent on the day at 80.31 yen, just shy of last week's four-month high of 80.38. Traders reported an option barrier at 80.50 yen with hedge funds ready to buy the dollar on dips if the U.S. jobs numbers disappointed. A break of resistance at 80.60-65, a chart triple top marked between May and June and a 50 percent retracement of the dollar's March to September decline, could signal further gains. ``A good U.S. jobs number will no doubt give a leg up to dollar/yen,'' said John Hardy, currency strategist at Saxo Bank. ``From a medium-term view, we are bullish on dollar/yen and the pair has established a base around 79 yen for a rally to 88 yen in a year's time,'' he said. The yen has come under pressure because recent Japanese data and corporate earnings have been soft. Third-quarter economic output data, due on Nov. 11, is also likely to have contracted. Payrolls processor Automatic Data Processing said private employers added 158,000 workers last month, bolstering expectations that the non-farm payrolls report due at 1230 GMT may beat forecasts. A Reuters poll forecasts a rise of 125,000 U.S. non-farm payrolls in October. The unemployment rate is seen ticking up to 7.9 percent. Any market reaction to the jobs data may be short-lived given the uncertainty of the outcome of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election.EURO ZONE STRUGGLES Some, however, are less sure about a sustained rise in the dollar as investors fret over the so-called ``fiscal cliff'' of looming tax rises and spending cuts in the United States. ``Over the course of the next month we would expect to move lower in dollar/yen, any upside above 81 would be surprising driven by U.S. negativity surrounding the fiscal cliff,'' said Christian Lawrence, currency strategist at Rabobank. The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.2885, a three-week low, as traders sold the single currency, triggering an option barrier at $1.2880. Bids from Asian central banks and Middle East investors were cited below $1.2850. However, the euro held within the $1.2800-3200 range seen since September, underpinned by the European Central Bank's pledge to buy bonds of indebted euro zone countries that seek aid. Signals in the option market showed the pair was likely to trade in a range in coming weeks. The one-month implied volatility on euro/dollar options fell to fresh five-year lows around 7.50 percent. Data on Friday showed peripheral euro zone countries were still struggling. Spain's manufacturing sector shrank last month at it fastest pace since July, while Italian factory activity shrank in October for the 15th month running. Commodity currencies eased after rallying earlier in the day. The Australian dollar hit a five-week high of $1.0420 before giving up gains to stand at $1.0380 as caution set in before the U.S. jobs data. The currency was helped by Thursday's improvement in manufacturing data from China, Australia's main export market.\",\n",

              "       'The minutes released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve are a must-read for those interested in the complexity of modern central banking—if only for the striking contrast between the milquetoast discussion of the economy and the many policy and market complexities.    There is little that is new or noteworthy in the sections on economic developments and prospects. The bottom line is also a repeat of what has characterized many post-global financial crisis minutes: a more muted immediate economic outlook (growth and inflation) coupled with somewhat greater optimism for the longer term—all on a baseline characterized by the usual references to \"modest,\" \"moderate\" and \"cautious.\"   By continuing the practice of compensating for a somewhat softer short-term outlook with upward adjustments thereafter, the FOMC is sidestepping an issue that has now entered the mainstream lexicon with a bang because of recent remarks by Larry Summers and Paul Krugman. It\\'s what\\'s being called \"secular stagnation\" and what Pimco in 2009 labeled the \"new normal\"—namely, a prolonged period of low growth and persistently slow job creation.    The minutes\\' rather subdued economic discussion contrasts with the large number of open policy (and therefore market) questions.    (Read more: Fickle Fed: Taper could arrive in \\'coming months\\')   From the interaction between the two main tools (asset purchases and forward policy guidance) to the consideration of new ones (lowering IOER), and from how and when to taper to the best way to communicate with markets, the minutes paint a truly complicated policy mosaic. Further, it is one that is still in the making and whose ultimate shape—and therefore impact—is subject to considerable uncertainty.   The complexity also extends to the specification of the intermediate policy targets that are so crucial for fine-tuning the policy response and thus delivering desired outcomes. Specifically, Fed officials posed the legitimate question of whether the commonly followed unemployment rate overstates the improvement in the labor market and, probably more controversial, whether it makes sense to add an inflation floor.    Finally, the minutes suggest that this is a Fed that is contemplating not only what could go right if it continues on the current policy path but also what could go badly wrong.    For this reason, officials \"considered scenarios under which it might, at some stage, be appropriate to begin to wind down the program before an unambiguous further improvement in the economic outlook was apparent.\" Why? Because of \"concerns about the efficacy or costs of further asset prices.\"    Such complexity can paralyze market participants at a time when the Fed in particular and central banks in general continue to play an important role in asset price determination. Yet some aspects are less ambiguous.   (Read more: Good news: Bubble concern is at a five-year high)   Taken in their entirety, the minutes provide further support for a consequential hypothesis: As part of a forthcoming policy evolution, the Fed wishes to encourage markets to delink their assessment of the two main policy tools—thereby enabling Fed officials to strengthen forward policy guidance, reduce (very gradually and carefully) heavy reliance on balance sheet operations and avoid a repeat of the May-June disruptions to the functioning of markets.    Fed officials may even be tempted into cutting IOER as a way to help manage this tricky and uncertain policy pivot.  (Read more: Yellen must promote strong recovery)   This is the reason why Pimco stresses greater differentiation in portfolio positioning.   We have been favoring the front end of interest rate curves while shying away from the long end—a point that my colleague, Bill Gross, has stressed repeatedly in his writings and tweets. It is also why, given current price levels, we feel that risk assets are becoming consequentially more dependent on a proper recovery in fundamentals and not just continued policy support.    And it is why we believe that greater attention should be devoted to recent disparities in performance among and within some major asset classes.

To make money, you have to be able to believe the CEO, he said.\"Otherwise it\\'s all just blather,\" he said.With Micron, President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra has been a straight shooter about both the good and bad facing the company, Cramer said.So when Mehrotra says the current quarter is the \"trough\" for the business, you can believe him, Cramer said.And if Micron is expecting a pickup in business, Cramer said, other companies related to it in the semiconductor space could present attractive investing opportunities.Western Digital is a name to look at, Cramer said. Mehrotra mentioned tightness in the flash memory category, and Western Digital is a competitor there.While not all aspects of its business are winners, such as disk drives, Cramer said he thinks it can continue marching higher; it\\'s up nearly 60% year to date.\"In the past, when the cycle\\'s turned ... this $58 stock has rallied through $100 — it\\'s hit those lofty levels twice in the last five years,\" he said. \"I think Western Digital can do it again.\"Micron also indicated softness around PCs, attributing it to Intel having trouble making chips, Cramer said.What does that mean for those doing a read-through? Look to AMD, Intel\\'s main competitor.\"Another reason to buy AMD,\" Cramer said.Cramer said executing a read-through on Darden follows the same process, starting with credibility of management and analyzing what was said on the conference call.Darden pointed to Olive Garden as the main culprit for its revenue coming in slightly below estimates.\"The stock got slammed [and] looked like it would take the whole restaurant cohort with it, given the pervasive presence of the bargain Italian chain,\" Cramer said.It wouldn\\'t have been a far-fetched assumption to attribute it to the consumer reining in its spending, Cramer said.

It meant the casual dining segment remained strong.

              "       '* Rate rise of 25 basis points tied to inflation, retailprices hike   * Future policy moves hinge on inflation, fiscalconsolidation(Updates with IMF report, background)   By Aleksandar Vasovic   BELGRADE, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Serbia\\'s central bank raised itsbenchmark interest, already the region\\'s highest, by 25 basispoints to 10.75 percent on Tuesday, reflecting rising inflationand debt concerns.   Other central banks in Central and Eastern Europe have cutrates over the past two weeks, as growth slows across theregion, although Poland bucked the trend last week by keepingrates flat due to concerns over inflation.   Serbia stands out as an exception because of a cocktail ofrising inflation and debt and an economy sliding into recessionamidst crisis in the euro-zone, its main trading partner.   \"Considering that the increase of food prices andstate-controlled prices is higher than expected and thatinflationary expectations are on the rise, the Executive Boardhas decided to increase the benchmark rate  toprevent the spillover... to other prices,\" the Serbian bank saidin a statement.   Serbian inflation in August rose to 7.9 percent, up from 6.1percent in July, due to a poor harvest and the government\\'s bidto finance its 2012 budget gap amounting to 6.2 percent of GDPthrough a rise in value-added tax.   The central bank estimates that inflation should continue torise until mid-2013 and then slide back to its target band offour percent, give or take 1.5 percentage points, the same asfor 2012. However, some analysts voiced caution.    \"That inflation is not driven by demand ... in that sense,the monetary policy is powerless,\" said Miladin Kovacevic, ananalyst with the Belgarde-based Economics Institute.    Djordje Djukic, a lecturer of economics with BelgradeUniversity, said Tuesday\\'s rate hike was beneficial forportfolio investors, \"who will make profits on short-termmaturities, but bad for budget and debt\".   \"The effects (of the rate hike) on inflation are veryuncertain as the Serbian economy is highly monopolised andplagued by high production costs, low productivity andcompetitiveness,\" Djukic said.   RISING DEBT   The deficit, inflation and rising social discontent haveprompted the coalition government of nationalists andSocialists, which came to power in July, to borrow more. Thatincluded a Sept. 27 issue of a $1 billion Eurobond and a $1billion loan from Russia, planned for this year and next.   Serbia\\'s total public debt this year is expected to reach 60percent of GDP and the country wants a new stand-by loan dealwith the International Monetary Fund to reassure investors.

              "       'As the House impeachment inquiry enters a new, public phase, the White House communications office is expected to add two longtime Trump allies to its staff, where they will be tasked with running a proactive impeachment messaging operation, CNBC confirmed Tuesday.Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump supporter, and Tony Sayegh, a former Treasury Department spokesman, are both expected to join the White House shortly to work specifically on impeachment related communications, in addition to other special projects as necessary, a senior administration official told CNBC. Bondi and Sayegh\\'s jobs would be temporary,.Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is \"very pleased\" with the Bondi and Sayegh hires, a senior administration official told CNBC. Mulvaney believes they will \"help round things out\" as good communicators with strong political skills.The hiring of Bondi and Sayegh, both high-profile political veterans, represents a new, more offensive posture from the White House, which has struggled to devise a cohesive strategy in response to the growing House impeachment inquiry.Trump has so far been resistant to the idea of a special team of staffers who would focus solely on the impeachment, reportedly because he was concerned such an approach was passe in the age of Twitter and social media.\"Here\\'s the thing: I don\\'t have teams,\" Trump told reporters at the White House recently. \"Everyone is talking about teams. I\\'m the team. I did nothing wrong.\"The choices of Bondi and Sayegh come as little surprise to those in Trump\\'s inner circle. Bondi\\'s term as attorney general in Florida ended earlier this year, and in the ensuing months, her name has come up repeatedly as a potential Trump hire, either at the Justice Department or the White House.Bondi made headlines during Trump\\'s presidential campaign for accepting a $25,000 contribution to her political action committee from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, an apparent violation of rules prohibiting donations from nonprofits to PACs.The money was donated in 2013, when the Florida Attorney General\\'s office was considering whether to join a lawsuit against Trump\\'s now-defunct Trump University. The donation came a few days after Bondi announced that Florida might join the suit. Bondi ultimately decided the state would not take part in the lawsuit.Sayegh is a well-known Republican communications guru, having worked on several high-profile races and most recently as the most visible frontman for the GOP\\'s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Trump\\'s massive tax reform package. Within the White House, Sayegh is considered an ally of Jared Kushner, Trump\\'s son-in-law and senior advisor.Politico recently reported that Sayegh\\'s potential hiring had set off a turf war inside the West Wing, with some factions strongly backing the choice and others fearful it would give Kushner and his allies too much power over the impeachment communications strategy.— CNBC\\'s Eamon Javers contributed to this report.',\n",

It\\'s just not a full-time gig.Like many other Americans, she  works part time and it\\'s barely enough to pay for food, fuel and  shelter. Millions of Americans were working part time in November  but they would like to have been working full time. These  so-called \"involuntary part-time workers\" are an example of some  of the stubborn pockets of weakness that remain in the labor  market even as the jobs picture improves very slowly.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported Friday that nearly 8.2 million people  classified themselves as involuntary part-time workers in  November, meaning that they settled for less work because they  couldn\\'t get more. That\\'s around double the number of involuntary  part-timers in 2006, before the nation went into recession and  entered a prolonged period of weak recovery.  A separate group of more than 18 million people were working  part-time in November for non-economic reasons, either because  they are in school or they want to spend more time with their  children, for example.  The number of people who are involuntarily underemployed has gone  down since it hit 9 million in the depths of the recession, but  progress has been slow and rocky. \\'A Demand Problem\\'  For people like Gray, 63, improvement can\\'t come soon enough.  Gray, who lives in Cary, Ill., for years worked two jobs: a  full-time administrative job and, for extra money, a part-time  cashier job at a major home retailer. She was laid off from her  full-time position, which paid close to $16 an hour, in January  of 2012.  She was left with a part-time job that pays $12.40 an hour. That  plus some unemployment compensation she receives is barely enough  to cover her mortgage and other expenses. She sometimes relies on  her church for food, and worries what will happen when the  unemployment runs out at the end of the year.  She\\'s spent nearly a year looking for another receptionist or  administrative position.  \"I\\'m on the computer, it seems, 24/7. I am networking. I\\'ve  walked out my resume to 83 companies,\" she said. She\\'s also taken  classes on how to interview and on invoicing, and she plans to  take another one on PowerPoint.  She\\'s had many job interviews in the past 12 months, but no  full-time job offer.  Gray said she can\\'t work any more hours as a cashier because a  tumor on her foot makes it difficult to stand for a long  time.  According to her doctor, the mass isn\\'t cancerous, she said, but  she can\\'t afford to have it removed. Her insurance as a part-time  worker wouldn\\'t be enough to cover the procedure and  rehabilitation.  Gray will turn 64 in February, which means she won\\'t qualify for  Medicare for another year. Until then, she said, she needs a job  that offers health insurance.  She\\'s hoping to avoid dipping into Social Security for as long as  possible because the longer she waits, the more she stands to  collect.  \"I was actually hoping to hang on until 70,\" she said.  She may still be in for a tough slog. Heidi Shierholz, a labor  economist with the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute,  said the basic issue plaguing involuntary part-time workers like  Gray is the same one plaguing the overall labor market: There\\'s  just not enough demand to compel employers to add to their labor  costs substantially.  Shierholz said she expects involuntary part-time workers to  gradually see improvements but \"it is a going to take a long  time.\"  \"I think by far the dominant reason that we aren\\'t seeing  employment in both dimensions — full (time) people or  ramping up hours for workers that already are there — is  just a demand problem,\" she said.  Once employers have more work that needs to be done, they\\'ll add  more hours for people to do it. \\'Now I Have to Watch Everything\\'  Debbie Fiore doesn\\'t see that happening any time soon at the  small company where she works.  Fiore, who lives in Nottingham, Md., lost her full-time job with  a long-term care company nearly two years ago, and has struggled  for more than a year to find another job.  A friend connected her with a small company that hired and  trained her for an accounts payable and receivable job. She works  about 25 hours a week and makes about half what she used  to.  Fiore, who turns 57 this week, and her husband struggle to pay  their bills.

We\\'re going to start using Roman numerals, so it\\'s VI.  We\\'ve had the privilege on five of -- this will be the fifth time  -- save one of our Delivering Alphas, each time we\\'ve had the  privilege of Treasury Secretary of the United States being with  us, back to Mr. Geithner\\'s term and now, for the third time, the  76th Treasury Secretary of the United States, please welcome to  the stage, Jacob Lew and his interviewer, Steve Liesman, chief  economics correspondent for CNBC. Got to get the title right.  STEVE LIESMAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for continuing this  tradition of kicking off Delivering Alpha with us.  JACOB LEW: Great to be with you this morning.  STEVE LIESMAN: Am I right that you were just a little late  because you were meeting with the lyricist for the musical that\\'s  going to be made with your tenureship? Is that right?  JACOB LEW: Just like every other New Yorker, I was stuck in  traffic.  STEVE LIESMAN: Will it be rap?  I want to start off with some of the headlines. I mean, it\\'s been  a series of headlines from your brief, so to speak, over the last  several days.  This morning there\\'s a story that an executive who oversaw some  of the places where there was alleged phony accounts created at  Wells Fargo made $125 million. Do you feel this is money that  should be clawed back or there should be systems in place to claw  this money back?  JACOB LEW: The consumer protection agency that took action  against Wells Fargo is an important new addition to our  protections for individuals and for the financial system. It  didn\\'t exist before financial reform. I think they uncovered  practices that they have taken action against. I don\\'t comment on  specific regulatory matters. But what I can tell you is what I\\'ve  seen from what they\\'ve done is bad behavior they were correct to  take action against. And how that flows through in terms of next  consequences is going to depend on the facts of the case.  What I can tell you is there\\'s a lot of talk in Washington these  days about rolling back Dodd-Frank, about rolling back the law,  changing the law that created the agency that uncovered and took  action against this. This ought to be a moment when people stop  and remember how dangerous the system is when you don\\'t have the  proper protections in place.  This is something that our watchdogs found. If they were not  there, they would still be going on. This is a wake-up call. It  should remind all of us, and firms, that culture and compensation  make a difference. How you reward people, how you motivate  people, and what values you hold people to matter.  There\\'s a public responsibility, and I think the CFCB took action  reflecting the public responsibility, and there\\'s a private  responsibility. And we each have to do our part.  STEVE LIESMAN: But if culture and compensation make a difference,  then why wouldn\\'t you support a clawback of this?  JACOB LEW: I\\'m not commenting one way or the other on the  clawback. I really am not going to comment on the facts of the  specific case. It\\'s being reviewed by an independent regulator.  It wouldn\\'t be appropriate for me to speculate on something that  I don\\'t know all the facts of. I think I\\'m addressing the issue  in a pretty conclusive way. This is unacceptable behavior. And  it\\'s the kind of behavior that we need to be able to catch and  stop.  STEVE LIESMAN: We\\'ve had billions of dollars of fines levied on  financial institutions. And still this behavior is still being  uncovered. Is Justice going far enough here? Do we need to be in  a situation where, for example, companies are not allowed to  plead that they didn\\'t commit the alleged act and that there are  individual indictments brought? We haven\\'t seen that in any of  these financial crimes, or very few of them.  JACOB LEW: We have, I think, taken action on a pretty dramatic  basis to put fines, penalties in place for firms that have acted  badly. The question of whether or not to pursue criminal  prosecution is a decision that prosecutors ultimately make. We  have made clear we don\\'t believe that anyone is too big to jail.  It\\'s up to prosecutors to decide how you pursue the criminal  charges. It\\'s not up to regulators or the policymakers.  What I can say is that the pattern of behavior that we\\'ve seen  here is something that needs to stop. It is not acceptable to do  things that are designed to increase either an individual or a  firm bottom line by deceiving consumers and passing along charges  that are either invisible or they don\\'t know about.  And this is not the same as a financial crisis issue. This is  really a consumer protection issue. I don\\'t think this is a  moment where we have to ask the kinds of questions that we did in  2008 about what it means about the underpinnings of the financial  system. But when I hear people say we want to roll back the  statute that created the consumer protection bureau, this is yet  another proof point that it was the right thing to create, it\\'s  the right thing to have an independent director, and it\\'s the  right thing to make sure that there\\'s somebody, and an entity  watching over our system, to make sure that individuals get clear  information about their financial products and, when firms or  individuals behave badly, that somebody finds out about it and  takes action.  STEVE LIESMAN: Moving to another company story which is in the  headlines, and you\\'re doing specifically with this issue of  Apple, an attempt by the European Union to get 14 1/2 billion  dollars of back taxes.  Beyond the company-specific story, is this an attempt by the E.U.  to essentially grab unpaid American taxes?  JACOB LEW: You know, Steve, I have an op-ed this morning in the  \"Wall Street Journal\" where I went into some length describing  our views on this. But let me briefly reprieve what I\\'ve said on  this. We have for some time told the European Commission that we  believe that this is an inappropriate approach. Why is it  inappropriate? We agree with them that it\\'s wrong for companies  to avoid paying their fair share of taxes to get to zero or very  low tax rates by taking advantage of tax havens.  But the action that the European Commission took is out of the  framework of normal tax policy, a retroactive tax that reaches  into another country, another jurisdiction\\'s tax base, in order  to make sure that a firm pays its taxes. We agree with them that  firms should pay their taxes. But when it\\'s U.S. income, we think  that that tax should be paid in the United States.  We\\'ve done a lot of work over the last two years to work on an  international basis to make sure that -- to share information  better. And we have an ability to close several loopholes that  have contributed to the erosion of tax bases around the world. We  need to take action in the United States to decisively change and  pushing firms to take their income overseas. We have a broken  corporate tax code.  We have the highest statutory tax rate in the developed world.  It\\'s riddled with deductions and loopholes that give advantages  that we don\\'t really need or would design for for today\\'s  economy. And the result is we see U.S. companies trying to impart  income in lower tax jurisdictions.  Now, those lower tax jurisdictions are for doing some things that  aren\\'t right also. The race to the bottom with low tax rates to  be a magnet for those companies, that has to change too.  But what action do we need to take in the United States? We need  to fix our tax system. We need to close the loopholes. We need to  lower the statutory tax rate. And one of the things that we\\'ve  proposed, which I believe is an idea that will still have  resonance in the year to come is that the revenue that we get by  putting a one-time tax on income that\\'s parked overseas will  produce one-time revenue that ought to be used to fund an  investment in infrastructure in this country.  So we can do two things at the same time. We can fix a broken tax  code. We can make it so that our companies don\\'t feel they have  to leave the United States to put their income overseas. And we  can fix our broken infrastructure.  What I don\\'t think is right is for tax authorities and other  jurisdictions to reach into our tax base and to remove the  ability for us to execute what I just described.  STEVE LIESMAN: So if they\\'re reaching in on Apple, are there  other company cases yet to come?  JACOB LEW: There are a number of pending matters --  STEVE LIESMAN: Pending, but what about ones that you think  there\\'s going to be more of a grab at this point?  JACOB LEW: I can\\'t speak to the European Commission, but we have  spoken on the policy. We don\\'t address individual cases. As I  mentioned before, I\\'m not addressing the individual case that  they choose to act on.  STEVE LIESMAN: So does that mean you won\\'t join as a party to the  case in Europe, to join as an amicus, so to speak?  JACOB LEW: Well, the European procedure is a little bit different  than ours. They are very aware of our views. We\\'ve submitted our  views in a pretty formal way. The parties here are the government  involved and the company involved. They\\'ve both indicated their  intention to appeal. And we\\'ve made our views known to the  authorities in Europe. And we\\'ve done it in a way that our views  will be before the commission on future matters as well.  STEVE LIESMAN: Let\\'s talk about the tax rate, the right corporate  tax rate. 35% is the current top rate, just the federal part.  There\\'s another six points or so according to the OECD that would  be added on some level. You proposed 28. It seems like the House  Republicans wanted 25, and Donald Trump wants 15.  15 would be toward the lower end of the OECD. 12 1/2 is Ireland.  Germany is around 15. Why wouldn\\'t we want a rate that low that  would make America very competitive?  JACOB LEW: The principle that\\'s driven our work on tax reform is  that it has to be revenue neutral. We are -- I don\\'t think -- it  would not be right for us to have individuals pay more taxes for  us to lower the corporate tax rate.  What we\\'ve proposed doing is eliminating loopholes and deductions  and using the revenues that we get by doing that to reduce the  tax rate on the business side as much as we can. We got to 28%  essentially because that was the amount of loopholes that we  could close.  STEVE LIESMAN: I get what you\\'re saying, and that makes perfect  sense on one side of the ledger. But the other side of the  ledger, at 28, you\\'re still not competitive and there\\'s still a  13-point incentive for companies to go overseas.  JACOB LEW: In the 25-28% range, we\\'re getting pretty close to the  average. And a few minutes ago, I talked about the race to the  bottom. Some of the pressures on countries that cut their tax  rates to low rates in order to be a magnet, if we, as we have  discussed in the G20 and the OECD and other international bodies,  truly believe that we need to close down the pathways to tax  avoidance, we\\'re going to need to conform to some norms. And  having countries go to very low tax rates is part of the problem.  We have our problem. We have a very high rate and a broken  system. We need to fix our system and take a look at theirs as  well.  STEVE LIESMAN: Is this a failure of the administration for  corporate tax reform here?  JACOB LEW: I actually think that if you look at the history of  tax reform, it often takes many years for it to kind of take  hold. And it\\'s not unusual for it to begin in one administration  and finish in another. I feel we\\'ve made actually a great deal of  progress working through bipartisan conversations to build a  growing consensus around the kind of approach that I\\'ve  described.  I think that there\\'s an environment now where the political  environment is not one where it has been ripe to take up  something like this. But the ideas that we\\'ve been promoting will  be the foundation for action in the future.  So I actually feel we\\'ve moved significantly toward tax reform.  You know, it takes a desire on the part of Congress to do  something hard. Hard things don\\'t happen unless there\\'s a real,  real desire to do it. And you need a partner. We have had  individual partners, but, as a whole, we have not had that  commitment.  STEVE LIESMAN: But if you look at this issue from outside the  Beltway, one guy is at 28, the other guy is at 25. Let\\'s get in  the room, spend 7 minutes, and we\\'ll make a deal. It seems like  you were impossibly close almost the entire time and didn\\'t make  it down there.  JACOB LEW: You and I have discussed this a number of times,  Steve.  STEVE LIESMAN: And I still don\\'t have a good -- not from you, but  in general.  JACOB LEW: I do believe that the people that we\\'ve engaged with,  who have been leaders on the Republican side, now Speaker Paul  Ryan, some senators who have been engaged in it, we\\'ve had a lot  of conversations that lead me to believe there is the basis for  an agreement. I just think the time for that agreement is  probably not the next four months.  STEVE LIESMAN: Do you look back --  JACOB LEW: In terms of need to do it, you look at the  infrastructure component of this, I think there\\'s an urgency  right now to dealing with infrastructure. You look at the action  taken by the European Commission, that\\'s an urgency that we need  to act if we want to protect our tax base.  You have an alignment of forces right now that I think create a  real opportunity. And I certainly think that\\'s an opportunity the  American people would be well served if Congress takes advantage  of.  STEVE LIESMAN: Let\\'s talk about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Again, that\\'s another program or effort by the administration,  worked hard on it, seemed to get agreement, and now can\\'t get it  through Congress. Do you regret that? Is that a failure of the  administration?  JACOB LEW: Well, first, I wouldn\\'t draw conclusions about what we  can and can\\'t get through.  STEVE LIESMAN: I\\'m watching my clock here.  JACOB LEW: There\\'s still time for the TPP, Trans-Pacific  Partnership, to be approved.  Let\\'s start with the substance. TPP is a good economic deal for  the United States. It\\'s good for American workers. And it\\'s good  for U.S. security interests in the world. It means that they will  have a more level playing field. American products and services,  which are best in the world, will be able to compete on stronger  ground. And it retains the U.S. leadership in the world on  important strategic issues.  So I think it\\'s vitally important that we get it approved. I  believe there\\'s still support for TPP. There\\'s clearly opponents  of TPP. I can\\'t question that. We\\'ve passed through the Congress,  about a year ago, the underlying legislation, Trade Promotion  Authority, which provides the procedural basis to approve TPP.  TPA, I believe, was a harder vote than TPP. It was an  abstraction; it wasn\\'t a specific agreement.  I can point in TPP to how it strengthens labor standards, how it  strengthens environmental standards, how it raises business  practices closer to our own. I can point around the world to  countries that are already taking policy actions, whether it\\'s  Mexico or Vietnam, to meet some of those standards.  I think we have the substance profoundly on our side. What I  think the challenge we have -- and this is a big challenge. We  can make the case that it will improve growth in the United  States, and more GDP should be good for everyone. Where we\\'re  running into a problem right now is the sense that is not just in  the United States, but it\\'s in other parts of the world, that  more growth does not necessarily mean better wages or better  opportunity for working people.  I think the issue that is the real issue that we\\'re going to have  to deal with is to show how the benefit gets to individuals. And  that\\'s bigger than TPP. I think we saw that in the United Kingdom  in the vote recently on the referendum.  STEVE LIESMAN: And that\\'s a failure at every level of leadership,  when it comes to economic issues, the issue of trade and its  benefits. The support of the American people has eroded almost  across the board.  JACOB LEW: Right. But the point I just made, Steve, is it\\'s  broader than trade. I think it gets to the question of a social  compact. I think it gets to the question of how free market  capitalism and liberal democracy thrives. We have to ask some  serious questions about what is it that\\'s holding wages back?  What is it that\\'s preventing individuals from feeling that they  have a share in growth?  I know what we can do at a public policy level. At a public  policy level, talking about infrastructure, and we talk about  skills. If you want to have working people feel that they have a  stake in the future, they have to have the skills to get jobs in  the economy of the future, and they have to have the ability to  get to and from home and work. And they have to see a growing  economy that\\'s going to grow the kinds of jobs that they can take  advantage of. That\\'s bigger than trade.  I think we have a confluence of things that have been going on  between technology and trade and the changing structure of our  economy that are making it a challenging moment. But TPP on its  face should be a clear plus. And we\\'re going to continue to make  that case. And I think we\\'re going to have to demonstrate the  commitment to working families.  STEVE LIESMAN: But, I mean, in that equation, you have to address  the omnibus criticism of the Obama administration, which was one  of regulation that tamped down on private enterprise, and too  much government intrusion into the private sector that really  kept some of the gains getting to individuals.  JACOB LEW: I think if you look at where the economy was when we  took office just under eight years ago, it was in the middle of  the greatest recession since the Great Depression. We were seeing  unemployment at 10%. There was no bottom. We put in place an  economic program that\\'s lifted the United States out of that  recession. We\\'ve seen sustained growth. We\\'ve seen 15 million new  jobs. We\\'re seeing wage growth. And some of these things that  you\\'re just labeling regulation are also why we\\'re able to be in  a place to meet our commitments to reduce our emissions and to  meet the standards to make this a safer world by having our  climate problems not engulf our future.  There\\'s a lot of things going on inside the package that you call  just more regulation. This economy is a stronger economy because  of the policies we\\'ve pursued. It\\'s not as strong an economy as  we would like to see. A lot of what I see as having held back the  U.S. economy is the headwinds internationally. We\\'ve seen  probably a half a percentage point of GDP shaved off the U.S.  economy because demand globally has been weak.  That\\'s one of the reasons we put so much time into trying to help  move the global debate towards using more policy tools to grow  demand and grow the economy. And we\\'ve made progress there. I  think we\\'ve made real progress. You are seeing a number of  countries around the world put in place more aggressive policy  using fiscal tools as well as monetary tools.  So I think there\\'s a lot of things going on. And I think right  now the United States is looked to in the world as being a  resilient economy that\\'s bounced back. What I tell my colleagues  around the world is we can\\'t be the only engine in the world  economy. There need to be multiple engines.  STEVE LIESMAN: I want to get to the overall economy. But one of  the things you\\'ve talked about is this need to invest in  infrastructure. The Republican nominee has accomplished something  like half a trillion dollars for spending on infrastructure. Do  you think that\\'s a good number?  JACOB LEW: I have to tell you, Steve, I haven\\'t dissected any of  the campaign proposals. I\\'m not doing politics in my current  life. I\\'m happy to talk about our policies, but I haven\\'t  actually taken apart the campaign proposals.  STEVE LIESMAN: Well, what\\'s the right number for infrastructure  investment? I assume you\\'re talking over a 10-year period.  JACOB LEW: Yeah, the right number is a very, very big one. We  have trillions of dollars that need to be invested. It\\'s not all  public money. What we did a year ago, a little over a year ago,  is we extended our surface transportation funding for five years,  basically at level funding, a little bit of an increase. Enough  to maintain what we\\'re doing now, not enough to build the new  facilities that we need to compete in the 21st century.  I think putting several hundred billion dollars of federal money  into a commitment on a multiyear basis to build infrastructure  would have an effect on state and local planning that would bring  more state and local resources to bear and, just as importantly,  would be a foundation for public-private partnerships, which is  what gives you the ability to leverage the amount of resource you  are putting in.  This is not all a question of just federal funding. But federal  funding has been the foundation. One of the things that we do is  we create a kind of certainty out there that there\\'s steady flow  to get projects off the drawing board. Without that, the whole  system slows down. And I think we have taken some time off from  driving that process forward, not to the point that it\\'s  irreparable, but we can\\'t take another decade off.  STEVE LIESMAN: At the same time, when we look at overall economic  growth, we\\'re doing just around 1% the last three quarters. How  much concern has this caused you that we can\\'t even get to the  new lower new normal of 2%?  JACOB LEW: I think when you go quarter to quarter, sometimes you  can overexplain an individual quarter.  We\\'ve seen growth in the low 2% for a number of years now. We\\'re  continuing to see strong labor markets. We\\'re continuing to see  improvements in wage growth. Consumers in the U.S. are very  strong. Housing is doing better. Autos have been doing very well.  The weak spot on the economic picture is investment. And I think  that if we could figure out what it is that\\'s going on in  investment and productivity to drive the investment numbers  forward, that would be very important. I mean, I think that there  is a lingering lack of confidence in the global economy coming  out of the economic crisis. It was a deep, deep economic crisis.  It left concern. How do you know we\\'re not snapping back?  I think in the United States we\\'ve demonstrated pretty decisively  that we\\'re not slipping back. There are other parts of the world  where every three to six months you wonder, is it going one way  or the other? There\\'s a lot of geopolitical risks. I think we  have to stabilize those risks.  One of the things we do when we meet in the G20 is focus on that.  And just last week we met in China at the G20 leaders meeting.  And I think you heard a few things at that meeting that were  important and different.  One is what I just talked about in terms of inclusive growth, in  terms of everybody sharing in it. We used to be a chorus of maybe  one talking about inclusive growth. All the leaders were talking  about inclusive growth. I think there\\'s a clear understanding  that we have to show that the benefits of growth get to working  people globally right now.  Secondly, there was a commitment to using all policy tools that  is much stronger than its been in the past, where heads of state  are talking about using the fiscal space they have more  vigorously. And I think on the exchange rate issues that have  been so vexing for a long time, we have a clear agreement to  refrain from competitive devaluation and to coordinate together  so that, at moments of volatility, we don\\'t see unilateral  actions that destabilize the global economy.  STEVE LIESMAN: I just want to come back to one of the things you  just talked about, which is using the fiscal side.  Is the fiscal side getting a message from the monetary side that  there\\'s only so far they\\'re willing to go? Mario Draghi last week  suggested, you know, we\\'re at a negative place. We don\\'t want to  go more negative. Possibility of the feds discussing raising  interest rates. Is the fiscal side getting a new message from the  monetary side?  JACOB LEW: As you know, Steve, I don\\'t comment on monetary  policy, particularly not fed policy.  STEVE LIESMAN: We\\'re talking about fiscal policy.  JACOB LEW: I don\\'t think that fiscal authorities needed messages  from anyone that the fiscal tools are important. We\\'ve been  delivering that message consistently since 2009. I\\'ve been doing  it as treasury secretary for the last three and a half years.  What we\\'ve seen over the last three years is a shift in the  debate.  When I became treasury secretary, there was a global debate about  austerity versus growth. We went to G7 and G20 meetings and there  would be debates about austerity versus growth. Those debates are  over. There is no more focus on austerity qua austerity. There is  a focus on making sure there are sustainable fiscal plans, but in  terms of short-term programs, the global community has embraced  the idea that we need to use all policy tools.  Now, if you look around the world, even in the last six months,  you\\'ve seen from China to Canada, from South Korea to Japan, more  use of fiscal tools in a responsible way. It doesn\\'t mean build  up debt that\\'s unsustainable. But it does mean don\\'t try to hit  deficit targets and debt targets in the short term when you need  to get your economic engine moving.  I think fiscal authorities during this recession put more  pressure on monetary authorities than they should have. I\\'ve said  that all along. Here in the United States, we went too fast in  the terms of some of the fiscal consolidation. There was a big  debate in the United States in 2011 and 2012 about this. We\\'ve  done okay. We could have done better. We could have had a little  more growth if we had put some of the savings a few years out and  less of the savings in the front end. Other countries didn\\'t do  as much as we did. They didn\\'t have the recovery. They didn\\'t do  a payroll tax. You know they didn\\'t come back repeatedly and put  more fiscal power to deal with economies that needed it.  It wasn\\'t always pretty in the United States, but we used all of  our policy tools. Our fed was aggressive, our fiscal program was  big, and our reform to the financial system was a structural  reform that we needed here in the United States.  There are still challenges in the future, but our call  internationally is for all the tools to be used.  STEVE LIESMAN: I want to talk about the challenges in the future.  Could you give us an idea -- maybe you\\'ve thought about this.  What goes in the letter that you leave for your successor?  JACOB LEW: Well, this may surprise you, Steve, but that\\'s  something you think about when you get to the last day, in my  experience. You don\\'t write it four months in advance.  I think that we\\'re still focused on the work we have to finish in  these next four months. I think that the economy that we are  working through now and that we will leave behind is much, much  stronger in almost every dimension than the economy we inherited.  I\\'m proud of that. That\\'s something the American people are well  served by.  That doesn\\'t mean that all of the challenges of the future are  addressed. I think these questions of income inequality are deep  economic and social issues. And we\\'ve put proposals forward that  we believe deal with that in a sensible way to pay for things  like education, starting with preschool, community college  education, and pay for infrastructure and to have an equitable  distribution of tax burden to pay for it. Those debates aren\\'t  over.  I think that if we take a long break from dealing with all of  those issues, we pay a price. It starts to stress both the  economy and the social fabric.  I think we\\'ve done enormously important work. I don\\'t think any  administration finishes the job. You pass the baton, and you give  some advice, and then you try from the sidelines to help move  things in the right direction.  STEVE LIESMAN: So I wonder if, four months in advance, you think  about what you\\'d do personally. Have you thought about going back  to Wall Street or academia? What have you thought about?  JACOB LEW: I have made one key decision: To live in the same city  as my wife for the next four years.  STEVE LIESMAN: I\\'m looking forward to Lew the Musical. And thank  you very much for joining us.  JACOB LEW: Thanks, Steve.

              "       'Starbucks\\' coffee isn\\'t the only menu item to go blonde.The coffee giant is now offering \"blonde espresso\" at all U.S. locations, marking the first time the company has given its consumers a chance to pick the espresso in their cup.This new espresso, made with beans from Latin America, packs 10 more milligrams of caffeine per shot and has a distinctively crisp, citrus flavor and a creamy texture.The company said it hopes offering customers a little more choice will make espresso more approachable to new coffee drinkers. This gateway espresso will be a permanent fixture on Starbucks\\' menu for the same price as Starbucks\\' Signature espresso shot.The company introduced blonde espresso in Canada before testing it in Austin, Texas, and Tampa, Florida. Starbucks said that it was well-received by customers and its baristas.Starbucks has worked hard to define itself as a go-to premium coffee destination, especially with its newer Roastery and Reserve Bar locations. Adding blonde espresso allows the company to appeal to consumers who haven\\'t acquired a taste for strong and bold coffee flavors. Because of this, Starbucks said that it isn\\'t worried about sales cannibalization.This product launch, which started Tuesday, comes at a time when Starbucks is faced with increasing competition from coffee companies like Dunkin\\' Donuts, which has increased its number and variety of premium coffee items, and even fast-food chains like McDonald\\'s, which has gained a foothold in the market with its $2 McCafe drinks.Starbucks is also under pressure to revitalize its U.S. sales growth. In November, Starbucks reset its long-term financial targets, and now expects global same-store sales growth of 3 percent to 5 percent, down from a prior goal of mid-single digit growth.',\n",

It joins France\\'s Total as a second western partner in Shtokman.Shares in StatoilHydro have surged by 22 percent since mid-August lows, outpacing an 18 percent rise by the DJ Stoxx Oil and Gas Index.

The social implications of its eventual behind-the-counter approval were much bigger than the financial implications for BRL. But Mr. Downey maintained he personally believed the drug should be more easily accessible and that he was on a mission to make it happen. In the first quarter of this year, BRL took in nearly 600 million bucks. Less than a hundred million of that was from a number of proprietary products, which includes Plan B. He also volunteered during his interview with me on CNBC this morning that during his tenure he\\'d been approached 12 times about doing a deal like this one. A dozen offers! Wow. Both Downey and Yanai said they think the generic drug sector will continue to consolidate.

We\\'re exiting a period where we feared total  devastation in the oil patch leading to bankruptcies and  defaults,\" he said, even as volatility continues to grip the area. \"It\\'s only the beginning of the fixing of this process.\"  Crude oil, which has surged by nearly 25 percent in the past  eight weeks, has been under pressure again this week due to  oversupply concerns. But it\\'s not discouraging Gerber from  sticking to his bullish case.  \"The supply and demand imbalance still exists currently. But we\\'ve seen some supply come off the market, and we\\'ve seen an increase in demand, which has created a little more of a perception of stability,\" he said. \"We think oil will probably sit around the $40 to $45 which we\\'re fine with.

              "       'The U.S. Federal Reserve should raise interest rates slowly even as fiscal policies under President Donald Trump are likely to help push economic growth beyond sustainable levels, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Friday.\"Appropriate policy calls for a slow pace of normalization in order to give the real economy an adequate growth buffer to withstand downside shocks,\" Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery at Prairie State College in Olympia Fields, south of Chicago. \"I favor taking a gradual path for the adjustment of the funds rate back toward its long-run level.\"The Fed in December raised rates for only the second time since the financial crisis, and this week held them steady to give labor markets and inflation a chance to strengthen further.Most Fed officials see three rate hikes this year, a pace considerably faster than in 2016 and 2015 but much slower than in past rate-hike cycles. Evans, who votes this year on Fed policy, did not specify a preferred number of rate hikes for this year in his prepared remarks, though a few weeks ago said three is not \"implausible.\"Evans said he expects the economy to grow at a 2 percent to 2.5 percent annual pace for the next couple of years, faster than its long-run sustainable pace of about 1.75 percent. Evans said he raised his estimate for growth because of expected tax cuts and other stimulus under Trump and the new Congress.Unemployment will fall to 4.25 percent over the next couple years, he predicted, well below its long-run sustainable rate of 4.7 percent. And that will help push inflation, now at about 1.7 percent, back up towards the Fed\\'s 2 percent goal by 2019.Some analysts have speculated that the expansionary fiscal policies Trump has promised would light such a fire under an economy essentially already at full employment that the Fed would have no choice but to hike rates faster to brake growth.Evans on Friday did not seem too concerned about such a prospect. He warned, as he has before, that if the economy is pushed to grow at 4 percent for more than a couple years without structural reforms that boost productivity and labor force growth, inflationary pressures would build and would ultimately force the Fed to tighten financial conditions.But he also said his estimates are for a much more moderate fiscal boost, though he added it is early in the legislative process and \"there certainly is a possibility of larger temporary stimulus, as well as some policies that might influence longer-run growth.\"A government report early Friday showing U.S. employers added more jobs than expected last month was \"very good\" news, Evans said.The unemployment rate moved up to 4.8 percent from 4.7 percent, but that was likely because of more people entering the workforce, a good sign for labor market health, Evans said at an event to benefit Prairie State College in Olympia Fields, south of Chicago.',\n",

              "       'The European  Central Bank (ECB) and European Banking Authority (EBA) are aiming to carry out a joint  stress test on Europe\\'s major banks in September, sources told Reuters. Austria\\'s FMA markets watchdog said on Wednesday  that the EBA plans stress tests this year even as the European Central Bank prepares to  take on supervision of top lenders from 2014. Sources told Reuters that the ECB, which was  involved in the background of the last round of EBA stress tests, was set to take a more  central role before it assumes supervisory powers over the euro zone\\'s banks. \"The preference is to have the EBA and ECB run   together, rather than have the reputational damage of having two (different)  ones,\" said a central bank source. The tests are \"likely to be in September\", he  added. Other sources said they also expected the tests in September, though the date has not yet  been finalized. The EBA\\'s predecessor the Committee of European  Banking Supervisors (CEBS) started conducting stress tests on major lenders such as Deutsche  Bank, Santander and Unicredit in 2010. But the shortcomings of the probes were laid bare  when Ireland\\'s banking system came close to collapse only four months after being given  a clean bill of health. \"As we said last year, we expect a new round of  stress tests in 2013 and discussions are on-going,\" an EBA spokeswoman said. ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said  last month that Europe wanted the ECB and the EBA to conduct coordinated stress  tests. EBA Chairman Andrea Enria has said that a key  addition to the next test willbe an examination of the quality of assets held by banks to  ensure they canabsorb losses properly in a crisis and leave taxpayers off the  hook.

              "       '(The following statement was released by the rating agency)Overview-- U.S. tower operator Crown Castle has agreed to acquire rights to about7,200 T-Mobile USA towers for $2.4 billion in cash.-- We expect leverage to increase to nearly 8x at the end of 2012, proforma for the transaction, and decline modestly to the mid-7x area in 2013.-- We are revising our outlook on the company to stable from positivesince we no longer expect it to achieve leverage of 7x within our two-yearrating horizon.-- We are affirming all ratings on the company, including our \\'B+\\'corporate credit rating;-- Issue and recovery ratings for Crown and its related entities remainunchanged at present, but will be re-evaluated when the company outlines adefinitive financing plan for the T-Mobile transaction.Rating ActionOn Oct. 2, 2012, Standard & Poor\\'s Ratings Services revised its outlook onCrown Castle International Corp.to stable from positive as a result ofthe company\\'s announced agreement to acquire rights to T-Mobile\\'s 7,200 towersin a debt-financed transaction valued at about $2.4 billion. At the same time,we affirmed all of Crown\\'s ratings, including the \\'B+\\' corporate credit rating.RationaleThe outlook revision reflects our view that there is no longer a one-thirdprobability of an upgrade given the additional debt associated with theacquisition. We now expect leverage, including our adjustments for operatingleases, to be nearly 8x as of the end of 2012, pro forma for the EBITDAcontribution from the T-Mobile towers. While we believe that the combinationof contractual rent increases, additional tenant colocation revenues on itsexisting towers, and somewhat faster revenue growth on the T-Mobile towerswill contribute to a low- to mid-teen percent increase in EBITDA in 2013, wedon\\'t expect leverage to drop to 7x or below before 2014 at the earliest. Ourpositive outlook had incorporated the possibility that Crown\\'s leverage wouldimprove to 7x or less within our two-year rating horizon, which we no longerbelieve is achievable.The ratings on Crown reflect the company\\'s aggressive financial policy, givenits historical use of debt and excess cash flow to fund large stockrepurchases. As a result, adjusted leverage is high, at about 7x for the 12months ended June 30, 2012. We anticipate that the company will benefit fromtower leasing revenue growth over the next year due to price increases in itscontracts and the addition of new tenants on its tower sites, which shouldcontribute to an increase in EBITDA in the mid- to high-single-digit area for2012 and 2013. The T-Mobile towers, which have a lower tenancy per tower thanCrown\\'s own business, have somewhat higher growth potential, although ourassumption for the addition of tenants on these towers is fairly conservative.Moreover, given the company\\'s aggressive financial policy, we believe it mayuse excess cash flow to repurchase stock rather than repay debt, especiallysince it has no near-term maturities.Crown is one of the largest independent tower operators in the U.S., with atotal portfolio of approximately 24,000 towers, in addition to variousdistributed antennae systems. Pro forma for the T-Mobile transaction, thecompany will operate a portfolio of over 30,000 towers.We view the business risk profile as \"strong.\"The business generates cashflows with a high degree of stability, given the long-term nature of thewireless carrier contracts and high renewal rates. In addition, there has beena trend toward longer term contracts in this business and carriers have littleto no flexibility to terminate early without fully honoring the contract.Typical of the tower leasing industry, the high operating leverage of thebusiness also contributes to extremely healthy tower gross profit and overallunadjusted EBITDA margins, which were 74.6% and 62.6%, respectively, for thesecond quarter of 2012. A high percentage of the business\\' EBITDA cantranslate into discretionary free cash flow, given very modest maintenancecapital expenditures. However, we expect Crown to use a significant amount ofits discretionary cash flows to continue to repurchase its common stock.Crown benefits from continued subscriber growth in the wireless communicationsindustry, which has expanded both in terms of absolute subscribers andper-subscriber minutes of use. These trends and the need for more coverage andcapacity to accommodate demand have translated into additional tenants leasingspace on existing towers, a trend known as colocation. Moreover, the majorcarriers have upgraded their networks to provide higher speed wireless datacapabilities, which in many cases, has required additional tower equipment.The regional carriers also have increasingly added to their coverage areas tooffer plans competitive with the national players, which, in turn, haveboosted tower leasing revenues.Crown also benefits from stable monthly cash flows from carriers withsubstantial financial resources, including Verizon Wireless and AT&T Mobility.These long-term contracts have very high renewal rates and average annual rentincreases of 3%. Moreover, the towers have the capacity to support multipletenants, providing additional upside to cash flows per tower, particularlybecause adding tenants to existing towers involves minimal incrementaloperating expense.LiquidityWe consider Crown\\'s liquidity \"adequate.\" Sources of liquidity includeavailability of $1 billion under the revolving credit facility, coupled withthe expectation that the company will generate about $960 million of fundsfrom operations in 2012. We note that the company has not yet identified aspecific financing plan to fund the T-Mobile acquisition, although our\"adequate\" liquidity assessment assumes it will be able to access the capitalmarkets for the transaction. We may revisit this assessment if the companydelays a financing plan or has difficulty in accessing the market.We expect that sources of liquidity will provide at least 1.2x coverage ofuses. We also expect Crown will continue to repurchase common stock, as wellas incur capital expenditures for land purchases, tower improvements, and newtower builds. The company is likely to maintain at least 15% minimum EBITDAcushion under its 6x total leverage covenant, which does not step down untilMarch 2014.Recovery analysisFor the complete recovery analysis, seethe recovery report on Crown, publishedAug. 2, 2012, on RatingsDirect.OutlookThe outlook is stable. As a result of Crown\\'s acquisition of the leasingrights to the T-Mobile towers, we expect that its debt to EBITDA will benearly 8x for 2012, pro forma for the T-Mobile transaction. We expect thisleverage to decline to the mid-7x area by the end of 2013.The rating could be raised if we came to expect a leverage reduction to 7x orlower on a sustained basis, which could occur if EBITDA increases at around a13% rate in 2013 rather than the low- to mid-teen percent area we currentlyassume in our base-case scenario. Conversely, and less likely, in our view, wecould lower the rating if Crown were to become more aggressive in itsfinancial policy such that it used debt to repurchase stock for in excess of$5 billion, since this would increase leverage to the 10x area.Related Criteria And Research-- Business Risk/Financial Risk Matrix Expanded, Sept. 18, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Companies\\' Maturities Are Manageable, ButLower-Rated Issuers Face Some Liquidity Challenges, July 23, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Companies, Strongest To Weakest, July 13, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Ratings Should Be Stable Overall During WeakEconomic Recovery, July 13, 2012-- A Matter of Policy: U.S. Telecom Companies Maintain High DividendPayouts, But For How Long?, May 30, 2012-- A Matter of Policy: U.S. Cable And Satellite-TV Companies Ratchet UpShareholder Payouts, May 16, 2012-- Top 10 Investor Questions: U.S. Telecom and Cable Industries, May 10,2012-- Assessing The Four-Notch Rating Gap Between The Two U.S.Direct-To-Home Satellite Video Operators, May 9, 2012-- Liquidity Descriptors For Global Corporate Issuers, Sept. 28, 2011Ratings ListRatings Affirmed; Outlook ActionTo                 FromCrown Castle International Corp.Corporate Credit Rating                B+/Stable/--       B+/Positive/--Ratings Affirmed; Recovery Ratings UnchangedCrown Castle International Corp.Senior Unsecured                       B-Recovery Rating                      6CC Holdings GS V LLCCrown Castle GS III Corp.Senior Secured                         BBRecovery Rating                      1Crown Castle Operating Co.Senior Secured                         B+Recovery Rating                      4Complete ratings information is available to subscribers of RatingsDirect onthe Global Credit Portal at.

His bullish report appeared to put a bit more wind in Netflix\\'s sails, as the tech giant rose a bit more than 3 percent in the session to close at $163. But if the analyst is right in his long-term call, the stock has even more substantial gains ahead than his current price target implies.To be sure, his target change did not rest on any massive reworking of expectations. Actually, the methodology that leads to his $195 price is almost pleasantly clinical.More from CNBC:Chart points to another 19% rally for Netflix, says top technicianAnalyst predicts a 50 percent crash for Netflix - but admits: \\'It is likely that we will be wrong for a while\\'How one trader plans to make a 300% profit on NetflixSanderson continues to expects the stock to earn $12.12 per share in 2021, and to trade at a forward price target of 22.5 in 2020 — leading to an expectation that the stock will trade at $273 in two and a half years\\' time. He expects investors to \"discount\" this price by 25 percent for every year in the future it is (as a way to be compensated for the risk of Netflix not achieving those earnings and/or multiple).At the end of January, when Sanderson slapped his prior one-year price target on the stock, one year from then was about two years away from 2020 — so $273 was divided by 1 plus 25 percent, raised to the second power. Now, a year from now is about a year and a half from 2020, so $273 is divided by 1 plus 25 percent, raised to the 1.5st power. Hence the price target moves from $175 to $195.This simple arithmetic can cause one to forget the fact Sanderson is forecasting that Netflix\\'s earnings will explode from about $0.50 in 2016 to more than $12 in five years\\' time. And to further forecast that even after the stock does so, investors will still be sufficiently optimistic about future profits to slap a high earnings multiple on the company.Sanderson said in an interview Thursday on CNBC\\'s \"Power Lunch\" that the company has \"more than ample opportunity to continue to scale up [its] content investment on a global basis,\" and that \"the subscriber opportunity is sufficiently large.\"While some might be tempted to bet against such heady expectations, Dennis Davitt of Harvest Volatility Management uses the harshest language to warn against doing so.\"I\\'ve seen a lot of really good investors lose a great amount of money on stocks like Netflix, and that usually comes from when they short them,\" Davitt said Thursday on \"Power Lunch.\" \"It\\'s a momentum stock.\"However, Davitt says it would be prudent for Netflix investors to buy a downside put on the stock, in order to maintain their upside while protecting themselves from the potential for great downside.\"I think Rob\\'s right, personally,\" he said. \"But if Rob\\'s not right, it costs you 5 percent to own the \\'insurance policy\\' on the stock.\"Netflix is up more than 30 percent year-to-date.',\n",

Their names have been changed to protect them.The employers are not named, nor are the men who they allege acted inappropriately.In addition to being apprehensive of hurting their future career prospects, some of the women are also worried about retaliation from the men themselves.\"Everything in this town is predicated on relationships,\" said one woman who works in public relations (PR). \"Why make waves? That could be the next person to hire you.\"Several of the women said working on K Street requires them to routinely deal with unwanted touching, inappropriate comments or text messages, and suggestive remarks about their bodies and appearances.All of them said they hoped sharing their experiences, however, would start a much-needed discussion about behavior by men in the influence industry and hopefully begin, as one woman described it, \"a course correction.\"A lobbyist\\'s job routinely involves travel around the country for fundraisers, advocacy and events. Women recounted experiences where, on occasion, alcohol-fueled socializing led to unwanted advances from colleagues, bosses and public officials.\"When they are away from their district or on the road, they think it\\'s a free-for-all, and their manners or morality is gone. It\\'s out the window,\" said Allison, a lobbyist in her early 30s who said she has been harassed or assaulted by almost a dozen men, including other lobbyists and public officials, mostly when outside of Washington.During one trip to a political conference, Allison recalled how she and about 10 others decided to hang out poolside after a dinner and people went up to their hotel rooms to change.As she was getting ready with a friend, there was a knock at the door; it was another lobbyist attending the trip. Thinking he was there to walk down to the pool as a group, she opened the door to find him wearing an open robe with nothing underneath.\"Let\\'s go skinny dipping,\" Allison recounts him saying.When she recoiled, saying \"What the f---?,\" the lobbyist laughed and said the whole thing was a joke.\"Harassment is sometimes about power,\" said Lisa Banks, a partner at Katz, Marshall & Banks who specializes in workplace harassment. \"There\\'s a power differential in Washington, and most of those people are men. It\\'s certainly an environment that\\'s ripe for this, but it\\'s also a horrible scenario.\"Banks says her firm has recently seen an influx of complaints from women about experiences of harassment, but about half of the accusations have gone beyond the statute of limitations. Some women, she says, call to report things that happened decades ago.(Disclosure: Katz, Marshall & Banks recently represented a woman who accused D.C. celebrity chef Mike Isabella and other higher-ups in the restaurant group of harassment. This writer formerly worked at Kapnos, an Isabella-owned restaurant, but left before the suit began and was not involved.)Whether working in Washington or elsewhere, all the women who spoke with The Hill say that it is common for their colleagues to laugh off bad behavior, blaming it on alcohol or a \"boys will be boys\" attitude.Though some of the unsavory conduct described to The Hill occurred when alcohol was involved, other incidents did not.One month into a new trade association job, a board member invited Olivia to his hometown, a cross-country trip that was purportedly for work, where they were supposed to be setting the association\\'s goals and strategizing for the next year. He asked her to pick out some things to do and shows to see while she was there.Once she arrived, the two began working in the hotel suite, and when it came time to go out for the evening, he asked to change in the bathroom.The executive, who was married, emerged from the bathroom shortly after that with his pants undone, according to Olivia.\"He didn\\'t solicit anything, but the innuendo was there,\" she added.While she managed to fend off his advances, she said his inappropriate behavior continued even after she returned home. He eventually \"got the hint,\" she says, though the two still had to work together.\"It was one of the more horrifying experiences, because you just don\\'t know how to rectify it,\" she said. \"I did tell colleagues and my immediate boss about it, and they laughed it off and said, \\'That\\'s how he is.\\' \"\"I feel fortunate that I had the confidence and the voice\" to push back, Olivia added. \"Not everyone has that luxury.\"When women are harassed by board members or elected officials — those not employed by their own organization — coming forward about abuse can be complicated.After two receptions one night, a trade association lobbyist named Leslie recalled heading to another event in a group. A board member sat next to her and, despite being surrounded by others, tried to get her to kiss him.\"He kept saying things like \\'Why won\\'t you just kiss me?\\' and \\'Seriously, just kiss me right now,\\' \" she said. \"I climbed literally all the way over to the other side of the Uber. I was screaming \\'I have a boyfriend! I have a boyfriend!\\' \"\"Not that [having a boyfriend] means anything,\" Leslie added.Employers are legally obligated to protect employees from abuse, regardless of whether the harasser is part of an organization, said Debra Katz, of Katz Marshall & Banks.\"If they become aware that a board member, an elected official or even a [client] has acted inappropriately or sexually harassed an employee, the employer has the obligation to take corrective measures,\" Katz said. The employee must also agree on whatever actions are taken by the employer.In the corporate world, employers are seeking out answers on how to deal with harassment and make sure policies around it are \"state of the art,\" said Jason Schwartz, a lawyer specializing in employment law at Gibson Dunn.\"A lot of lobbying and PR shops may not have a sophisticated, built-out [human resources] HR operation. A lot of this is unfamiliar territory to them,\" he said. \"People are struggling to figure out how to respond.\"Rather than relying on a HR or legal department, Schwartz said some employers have opted to have an anonymous reporting system or designate a rotating employee as a safe person to confide in. Punishments are also important, he says.Some of Schwartz\\'s clients have implemented a clause that employees\\' bonuses could be taken away should a negative report be made against them.\"These kinds of concerns are being taken far more seriously now than they ever were,\" Schwartz said.But punishments become all the more complicated when it\\'s the men in senior roles who are accused of misconduct, which makes reporting their behavior difficult.Some K Street offices, women say, have a hypermasculine culture that makes it hard to come forward.Human resources is there \"to protect management, they\\'re not here to protect the people who report to them,\" said Liz, who worked for a trade association at the time. Her sentiment was echoed by nearly every woman who spoke to The Hill.\"Anything you said to HR went immediately back to the manager, and you\\'d get called into the manager\\'s office and get screamed at for going to HR.\"Several women told The Hill that they\\'ve worked at firms where the men leading it talk repeatedly and openly about the women in the office, commenting on their bodies and their clothing in ways that go beyond innocent compliments.During presentations led by a woman at a large trade group, the men in the room would allegedly send each other explicit and vulgar text messages, according to a woman shown those messages by one of the men.Male members of the association allegedly passed a list ranking how much they wanted to sleep with women from the Washington office. It was called the \"f---ability factor\" list.They would \"love to come up and tell you if you\\'ve dropped off the list\" or if you\\'ve been relegated to a lower ranking by, for example, getting married, Liz recalled.Three other women told The Hill that men, including high-ranking government officials and executives, would send them explicit text messages — occasionally with graphic photos — talking about their bodies and what it would be like to have sex with them.In a trade association\\'s Washington office, a man would habitually engage in phone sex during work hours, according to another man in the office who witnessed it.\"Every afternoon, like clockwork, I would hear panting, heavy breathing,\" said Brandon, whose desk was near the executive\\'s office. \"There were these conversations that registered above a whisper. ... When I listened closer, they were phone sex conversations.\"A second person who worked in that office at the time described to The Hill similar conduct by this person. Allegedly, once a complaint had been filed, the man was made to reimburse the group for the cost of the calls.Margaret, a woman who then worked at a consulting firm, recalled that high-ranking executives would come to her office and talk about sexual conquests and whom they found attractive, sometimes giving unsolicited shoulder rubs.She called it \"harassment creep,\" where actions start small and escalate into increasingly inappropriate behavior.One \"would put his leg up on my desk and \\'it\\' would be directly eye level with me,\" Margaret said. \"They want to see your reaction, to see how far they can take it with you.\"Two women described a tactic utilized during greetings or staged photo ops with clients and association members — each pointing to elected officials as the worst offenders.\"Rather than putting a hand here [while posing for a photo],\" said Margaret, grabbing her waist, \"it\\'ll be up here.\" She put her hand much higher, discreetly cupping the side of her breast.Another woman said one particular K Street executive would hug her in a similar way.\"I call it the side-boob hug,\" she said. \"It is a pro trick. … I think they teach this when they get inaugurated. It has happened a bunch with elected officials. Or they find a way to grab your ass. It\\'s amazing how often it happens.\"One of the biggest issues surrounding the debate over sexual harassment in every industry is that women have different interpretations of what crosses the line.In an occupation where the job description involves being nice in order to push a cause or raise money, one lobbyist named Jennifer said that men often get the wrong impression. She said that other lobbyists she knows have propositioned her for sex.\"I think it\\'s terrible, but I feel less harassed and more like they are testing the waters because it must have worked for them before. As soon as I\\'m like, \\'Uh, no,\\' they apologize,\" Jennifer said, adding, \"That\\'s happened quite often, actually.\"Legally, in most cases, unwanted comments or inappropriate touching must be continuous for an individual to file a lawsuit. The accusers must also show that the harmful environment was \"severe and pervasive,\" Katz said.One woman who worked at trade associations before joining a large K Street firm says she faced retaliation after coming forward about being harassed by a fellow lobbyist.An outside lobbyist hired by the organization where she worked pushed her against the wall of an elevator and tried to kiss her. Although he pulled back when she told him to stop, he began to send her a stream of text messages talking about how he wanted to be with her and how he was unhappy in his marriage.The lobbyist was close with other men in her office, and after she complained, her boss began to schedule lobbying outings involving things she hated and wouldn\\'t do: golf and cigar smoking.\"You don\\'t have to terminate someone, but you can make their workplace a living hell,\" she said.',\n",
              "       'More than 190 Democratic lawmakers sued President Donald Trump in federal court on Wednesday, saying he had accepted funds from foreign governments through his businesses without congressional consent in violation of the U.S. Constitution.  The complaint said Trump had not sought congressional approval for any of the payments his hundreds of businesses had received from foreign governments since he took office in January, even though the Constitution requires him to do so.  The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment but has said Trump\\'s business interests do not violate the Constitution. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require such customers to identify themselves.  At least 30 U.S. senators and 166 representatives are plaintiffs in Wednesday\\'s lawsuit, representing the largest number of legislators ever to sue a U.S. president, according to two lawmakers who are among the plaintiffs.  The Constitution\\'s \"foreign emoluments\" clause bars U.S. officeholders from accepting payments and various other gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.  \"The president\\'s failure to tell us about these emoluments, to disclose the payments and benefits that he is receiving, mean that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we don\\'t know,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, one of the lawmakers bringing the lawsuit, in a conference call on Tuesday.  Representative John Conyers, another plaintiff, added: \"President Trump has conflicts of interest in at least 25 countries, and it appears he\\'s using his presidency to maximize his profits.\"  The Justice Department declined to comment.  Similar lawsuits have been filed in recent months by parties including a nonprofit ethics group, a restaurant trade group, and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.  They allege that Trump\\'s acceptance of payments from foreign and U.S. governments through his hospitality empire puts other hotel and restaurant owners at an unfair disadvantage and provides governments an incentive to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment.  Rare to sue president  In a motion to dismiss one such lawsuit on Friday, the Justice Department argued that the plaintiffs had not shown any specific harm to their businesses, and that Trump was only banned from receiving foreign government gifts if they arose from his service as president.  On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said \"partisan politics\" was behind the lawsuit by the Maryland and District of Columbia officials.  Lawmakers rarely sue the president, so there are few federal court decisions the legislators can cite to prove their legal standing to bring Wednesday\\'s case, said Leah Litman, an assistant professor specializing in constitutional law at the University of California, Irvine.  \"But the constitutional provision they\\'re suing to enforce gives them a role in how it\\'s carried out, and that gives them a powerful standing argument,\" Litman said.  The lawmakers in Wednesday\\'s lawsuit will be represented in court by the Constitutional Accountability Center, a public interest law firm in Washington.Each lawmaker is paying a share of the legal fees from personal or campaign accounts.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.',\n",

              "       'It\\'s one thing to say gold is going higher. But, when Jeffrey  Gundlach, manager of the $49 billion DoubleLine, says he thinks  gold will hit $1,500 per ounce by the end of this year, that\\'s  something people pay attention to.  In a webcasted presentation called \"Penny For Your Thoughts\",  Gundalch noted the 96 percent reduction in the U.S. dollar\\'s  purchasing power since the Federal Reserve Bank was established a  century ago, likening the end of the gold standard to the silver  debasement of the Roman denarius from 64 to 270 AD. During the  question and answer period, Gundlach said he thought gold could  move to $1,500 this year.  The last time gold was at $1,500 was in April, 2013. Gold traded  at $1,260 per ounce on Wednesday.  (Watch: Stocks slide; worst hit in 3  weeks for Dow, S&P 500)  \"Of course, there\\'s a chance [Gundlach] could be right and gold  could go higher,\" said Richard Ross, global technical strategist  at Auerbach Grayson. \"But, there\\'s very little in the short-term  technicals to suggest that move has begun in earnest.\"  Gold has been trading in a range between $1,180 and $1,400 for  much of the past year, notes Ross. For the short-term, he is  keeping an eye on the $1,270 line, which is close to the current  150-day moving average. \"A break back above that level could set  us up for a retest of that resistance around 1,400,\" said Ross.  However, that range should be seen in the context of the  longer-term chart, according to Ross, a \"Talking Numbers\"  contributor. \"We\\'re still in a downtrend from the highs that we  established back around 1,900,\" he said.  Ross sees gold\\'s break below its 150-week moving average as  technically significant. Since the start of 2013, the 150-week  moving average has been relatively flat, near the $1,525 level.  \"You\\'ve got to get through 1,400 before you can trade 1,500,  clearly,\" said Ross. \"And, in the shorter term, you\\'ve got  through 1,270 before you can trade 1,400. So, there\\'s a lot of  ifs and buts here in that argument. We really need to see a base  breakout before we can call this a base.\"  Gina Sanchez, founder of Chantico Global, said that while there\\'s  a possibility that gold could go higher, she thinks the chances  are low. The World Bank\\'s reduction of global growth from 3.2  percent to 2.8 percent may cause some flight-to-safety buying of  bullion. And, global interest rates are low, which traditionally  augurs well for the yellow metal. But, Sanchez believes that  won\\'t last.  (Watch: World Bank: \\'Now is the time  to prepare for next crisis\\')  \"Even though we\\'re in a benign interest rate environment in the  U.S. – and certainly within Europe and Japan – I do  think that in the U.S., rates will likely start to trend higher  by the end of the year or into 2015,\" said Sanchez, a CNBC  contributor. \"That\\'s not great for gold. We don\\'t see a ton of  inflation. If anything, maybe there\\'s some deflationary  pressures, particularly in Europe.\"  Gold needs to feed on something, said Sanchez, but she doesn\\'t  see a lot of major economic pessimism or inflation worries.  \"I\\'m not sure that I see why gold, except for some short-term  reasons, might pop a little,\" added Sanchez.

To get people onto its mail-delivery service, PillPack needs patients to switch from their existing pharmacy, which often means transferring prescriptions from CVS or Walgreens, the two largest chains in the U.S.But PillPack has run into a significant roadblock in getting those transfers approved. CVS and Walgreens are rejecting an increasing number of their requests, claiming that PillPack isn\\'t getting proper consent from patients. PillPack says it always gets patient approval before making transfer requests and blames the pharmacy giants for unfairly refusing to honor them, sometimes hanging up on PillPack\\'s pharmacists or throwing the request forms in the trash.\"While incumbent pharmacies may be disappointed in the loss of business, it is unacceptable to make unsubstantiated allegations about PillPack\\'s practices while simultaneously creating systemic barriers that make it harder for a customer to switch pharmacies,\" PillPack spokeswoman Jacquelyn Miller told CNBC.The conflict has continued to escalate, with a source familiar with the matter telling CNBC that Amazon is documenting all cases of refused transfers.

Following Monday\\'s disclosure that two former Trump campaign officials were indicted as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\\'s investigation, continued political turmoil could have a potential \"long-term and very negative impact on capital markets,\" said strategist Boris Schlossberg. \"The critical question going forward is whether this is just a one-and-done, or whether it\\'s just the beginning of a very long and perhaps a very, very tedious judicial process that could really weigh both on Washington and Wall Street as we go forward,\" Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, said Monday on CNBC\\'s \"Trading Nation.\" These questions come as economic data have been \"superb,\" Schlossberg said. Specifically, he pointed to the latest consumer spending data, which reflected the largest monthly gain since 2009 (likely affected by spending related to recent hurricane devastation), and personal income, which also rose month-over-month. Still, \"markets are very concerned, because the big catalyst going forward is tax reform. That\\'s what the market is looking for as the next jump-start to get the economy going to the next level,\" he said.Should the administration\\'s agenda stall further, \"that could weigh very badly on the market,\" he said. According to a Bloomberg News report on Monday, Republicans are considering \"gradually\" lowering the corporate tax rate, and markets had a relatively muted response. Furthermore, the market is also ripe for some kind of pullback, Schlossberg said, which gives him an overall cautious view heading into the rest of the year. Others are less concerned about the probability that Mueller\\'s investigation into Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election could weigh meaningfully on equities. \"There is some trepidation on the Mueller indictments but we are starting to see Trump as teflon, so much so that we think he can \\'get away with\\' firing Mueller and markets would actually take that well as it would remove an overhang.

              "       'Amazon has finally  lifted the lid on its second-annual Prime Day sale, which it\\'s  touting as the \"biggest Amazon event ever.\"  On July 12, the online retailer will offer Prime members new  deals as often as every five minutes. That compares with a new  deal every 10 minutes during last year\\'s Prime Day. In all, the  sale will include more than 100,000 deals spanning \"nearly all  departments and categories,\" from televisions to vitamins. Amazon  did not provide a comparable number of items for last year\\'s  event, but said this is the largest number of deals it\\'s offered  in a single day.  The U.S. sale will kick off at 3 a.m. Eastern for existing Prime  members, as well as those who sign up that day for one of its  paid memberships or free 30-day trial. Unlike last year, Amazon  will offer a handful deals for Prime members in the week leading  up to Prime Day, on items including a 32-inch TV bundled with a  Fire TV Stick, which will sell for $119.99.   \"Following last year\\'s record sales, we have dramatically  increased the inventory behind many deals,\" said Greg Greeley,  vice president of Amazon Prime. That includes nearly double the  number of TV units in stock as compared with Black Friday and  Cyber Monday combined. Last year, some shoppers  complained on social media that the deals were selling out too  quickly.  Amazon\\'s Prime Day playbook is similar to its Black Friday  strategy, which also rolled out deals every five minutes. Company  spokeswoman Julie Law said some of the discounts will be deeper than  last year\\'s event.  During its inaugural Prime Day sale, held last July in honor of  the company\\'s 20th anniversary, Amazon sold more units than on  Black Friday 2014, which at the time was its biggest ever  (Amazon\\'s 2015 Black Friday event surpassed that metric). In  addition to driving sales, the event led to more new members  trying Prime than on any day in its history, Amazon said.  Though Amazon does not release information regarding the number  of Prime members, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners  estimates Amazon has 54 million U.S. members. The firm\\'s data also  shows that 73 percent of Amazon\\'s 30-day trial subscribers pay for  the first full year of membership. And 91 percent of first-year  subscribers renew for a second year, CIRP said.  Amazon has not set an explicit goal for this year\\'s event, though the company expects it to be \"another record-breaking  Prime Day,\" Law said. She said additional details regarding specific Prime  Day deals will be released closer to the event, including \"far  more\" limited-time lightning deals and deals of the day. Shoppers last year also grumbled on social media that the discounts were not as deep as they had expected, and that some of the items on sale seemed strange. One deal, for example, promoted a chef\\'s hat.  Law responded to criticism that the Prime Day discounts at times  seem random, saying the event is different from Black Friday in  that it\\'s not a gifting holiday. Instead, it\\'s the time of year  when shoppers are stocking up on such things as seasonal summer  goods and back-to-school essentials, she said.  \"What could be weird to one person may be wonderful to someone  else,\" Law said. \"We really stand behind the deals we had last  year and the deals we have this year.\"  Amazon\\'s announcement, while widely expected, comes one day after  Wal-Mart announced  a free 30-day trial  for its ShippingPass service, which is positioned as a  competitor to Prime. Similar to Amazon Prime, Wal-Mart shoppers  can pay an annual fee to receive unlimited two-day  shipping.   Wal-Mart\\'s version of the service costs $49 a year, compared to  $99 for an annual Prime subscription. However, Prime membership  includes additional benefits that aren\\'t part of Wal-Mart\\'s  program, including unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows.  Amazon also boasts a broader array of products, with more than 20  million items eligible for Prime. Walmart\\'s U.S. site has roughly  7 million items up for grabs.',\n",

On CNBC\\'s \"Fast Money,\" Baker said  that at a recent Miami conference of high net-worth investors,  about half were waiting for such a dip to buy.  The question, he added, was simple: \"Where do you want to be in  the market?\"  Cyclical sectors would likely lead the market higher, and it was  time to get out defensive positions, Baker said.  \"I\\'d go long the ETF in technology and short the staples. It\\'s a  good hedge,\" he said. \"It\\'s a pair trade, but I think you need to  be long.\"  TheStreet CIO Stephanie Link also said that cyclicals were  undervalued.  Link\\'s top picks included Eaton,  Stanley Black & Decker and  Ensco.  \"I think that the global economic story has changed because you  have more liquidity measures being implemented,\" she said.

              "       'There is a lot of tough talk emanating from the Middle East. Here\\'s a currency-trading plan in case the situation worsens.With all the news about oil output and rumors of possible military action in the Middle East, it\\'s a good idea to have a trading plan in the event of an oil shock. Rebecca Patterson, chief markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Institutional, is looking north for her plan. \"If you are trading currencies and you see a headline go across the tape saying something has happened, what\\'s the first thing you should do? If it\\'s a supply shock, I want to go with a current account surplus country. I want to be long the Norwegian krone,\" she told CNBC\\'s Melissa Lee.To keep the trade liquid, Patterson suggests using the euro  as a cross. Also, because \"we don\\'t know what levels we\\'ll be at if and when this happens,\" she says, \"we\\'re just going to use where we are now as an example.\"So for now, Patterson suggests entering the trade right around 7.6200, with a stop at 7.4000 and a target of 7.7000. Todd Gordon, co-head of research and trading at Aspen Trading Group, says the trade measures up nicely in technical terms. And Patterson adds that it\\'s not just the oil issue that could make this trade work.',\n",

              "       'With millions working and learning from home, some exchange-traded fund issuers are trying to capitalize on the shift to virtual living.Direxion kicked it off in April by announcing it would file for a work-from-home ETF, ticker WFH, tracking industries at the heart of remote connectivity such as cybersecurity, communications and cloud technologies.Whether others will follow Direxion\\'s lead remains to be seen, but there are already numerous options on the ETF market that investors can use to play the stay-at-home boom, market analysts say.\"It\\'s amazing how we\\'ve been talking about FANG stocks for so long, but they worked right into the whole stay-at-home world – online shopping, home offices, video streaming, ... modern communication,\" Tom Lydon, the CEO of ETF Trends and ETF Database, told CNBC\\'s \"ETF Edge\" on Monday.All four FANG companies — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet\\xa0— reported their first-quarter earnings results within the last two weeks. Shareholders responded well to all but Amazon, which said it would spend the entirety of its second-quarter profits on bolstering its coronavirus response. Netflix\\'s spike in new subscribers was a particular highlight.One of the most popular ways to trade these names using ETFs is via the\\xa0Invesco QQQ Trust\\xa0(QQQ), which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, Lydon said.\"The FANG stocks make up 35% of QQQ. If you add in Microsoft, it\\'s 47%,\" he said. \"So, it\\'s a great way to play it as we continue to be quarantined in this stay-at-home world because it doesn\\'t seem that their businesses are going to get weak any time soon. They just continue to pull away from the pack.\"ETFs that have the biggest position in the FAANG stocks\\xa0— which is FANG plus Apple\\xa0— include the\\xa0Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund\\xa0(XLC) at more than 47%, the Vanguard Communication Services ETF (VOX) at over 44% and the Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF (FCOM), also at 44%.Other existing products investors could consider include some of Global X\\'s more focused products, Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research, said in the same \"ETF Edge\" interview.He highlighted the\\xa0Global X Cloud Computing ETF (CLOU) and the Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ).\"Cloud computing [and] robotics ... [are] themes that I think have been driven home as people need more bandwidth to be able to work from home and as companies realize that they need more of an automation and use robotics when they can to improve the supply chain,\" Rosenbluth said. \"Some of these themes are really going to resonate with investors even more in 2020 than they have in the recent past,\" he said. \"And there\\'s a whole host of these products from First Trust, from ROBO, from other firms that are really in this space for investors that want to dig deeper into how you can play this stay-at-home theme.\"Jason Bloom, director of global macro ETF strategy at Invesco, suggested Invesco probably won\\'t be getting as granular as some others in the ETF industry anytime soon.\"We do try to be responsive, clearly, to changes in the structure of the market or fundamentals that would suggest that you have an investment theme that makes sense,\" he said in the same \"ETF Edge\" interview.\"We\\'re probably a little more conservative in that durability of the theme for us is ... a very high priority,\" Bloom said. \"So, if there\\'s a risk that the theme may only have a year or two or so before it runs its course, it\\'s probably not going to make it through our process, but if we think it has five, 10 years or more of durability then it certainly makes sense to us.\"Disclosure: Invesco is the sponsor for CNBC\\'s \"ETF Edge.\"Disclaimer',\n",

            " China will take steps to contain a renewed burst in bank lending and a larger-than-expected rise in the country's controversial trade surplus last month, senior officials said on Friday. Speaking on the sidelines of a annual parliamentary session, which ends on Friday, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said the authorities would place further controls on bank lending.\"From a commercial perspective, it is understandable for the banks to lend aggressively at the beginning of the year,\" Zhou told reporters. \"But from a macro perspective, after serious study, we decided to place further controls (on it),\" he said. He did not offer any timeframe. Lending data released this week reinforced concern that banks, awash with cash, may fund a new round of speculative investment. Lending surged by 413.8 billion yuan in February, compared with an increase of 149.1 billion yuan in February 2006. Separately, Commerce Minister Bo Xilai said the nation's trade surplus had been \"too large\" in February and reaffirmed that Beijing planned new steps to trim exports and step up imports. China on Monday reported its second-biggest monthly trade surplus on record, dwarfing forecasts and handing fresh ammunition to critics who say Beijing is giving its exporters an unfair edge by holding down the yuan. The surplus for February ballooned to $23.76 billion, with exports leaping 51.7% from a year earlier. \"We are also very nervous about that,\" Bo said of the size of February's surplus. \"We're seriously studying the whole situation to find the underlying reasons.\" One reason for the surge was a propensity among Chinese firms to ship their goods out of the country to prevent them from being penalized by possible policy changes, he said. The Commerce ministry would make appropriate adjustments to the export tax rebate system, paying special attention to the area of processing trade as that generated the biggest portion of the surplus, Bo told reporters, without giving details. Zhou also said the authorities were keeping a wary eye on inflation, which he said had been running too high. Asked whether the central bank would raise interest rates soon, Zhou said they were seriously studying the inflation situation and would take \"appropriate measures\".\n",

            " Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading.Ford — The legacy automaker's stock rose 2% after Ford reported better than expected earnings for the fourth quarter and updated investors on its plans for electric and autonomous vehicles. The company said it will spend $29 billion on the new technology through 2025. Revenue for the fourth quarter did miss expectations, however.T-Mobile — Shares of the telecommunications company fell more than 3% despite a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter report. T-Mobile reported 60 cents in earnings per share and $20.34 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv had penciled in 51 cents per share and $19.93 billion in revenue. The company's guidance for cash flow metrics in 2021 missed expectations, however, according to FactSet.Peloton — Shares of the at-home cycling stock fell more than 7% after the company outlined ongoing supply chain issues amid a surge in demand for its products. Peloton, however, reported sales growth of 128% during the fiscal second quarter, bringing in more than $1 billion in a single quarter for the first time in the company's history. Peloton earned 18 cents versus the 9-cent profit expected by the Street. Revenue came in a $1.06 billion, also ahead of the expected $1.03 billion, according to Refinitiv.Activision Blizzard — The video game maker led the S&P 500 on Friday with a nearly 10% gain after it reported fourth-quarter profit and revenues ahead of Wall Street's expectations. Rob Kostich, president of Activision Publishing, said Thursday evening that its \"Call of Duty\" franchise, including free-to-play \"Warzone,\" was a key driver of the company's business in 2020 and that the game is \"going to be front and center for us for a long time.\"Snap — The social media company saw its shares jump nearly 6% after beating expectations on earnings, revenue and user growth. Snap posted an adjusted earnings per share of 9 cents, versus 7 cents expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. However, the company issued a light first-quarter guidance and warned that Apple's privacy changes could \"present another risk of interruption to demand.\"Estee Lauder — The makeup company saw its shares rise 7.5% in midday trading after it reported a surprise fiscal second-quarter sales gain instead of the decline it had expected. Estee Lauder said stronger Asia-Pacific and online sales drove the revenue gain. Second-quarter sales in the Americas dropped to $1.05 billion from $1.23 billion a year ago.— CNBC's Yun Li, Maggie Fitzgerald and Jesse Pound contributed.\n",

Amazon said the facility could power the equivalent of 46,000 U.K. homes and would be the U.K. is \\\"largest corporate wind power purchase agreement.\\\" Additionally, two solar projects in North Carolina and Virginia will amount to 215 MW of total capacity, with Amazon expecting them to produce 500,997 MWh per year. The projects announced Thursday are expected to start generating energy in 2021. They are not owned by the company, but it says its commitment to purchase their output enables the projects to be built. In a statement issued Thursday, Amazon is Director of Sustainability Kara Hurst said the firm was \\\"committed to minimizing our carbon emissions and reaching 80% renewable energy use across the company by 2024.\\\"In June, Amazon was one of more than 700 firms targeted by 88 investors \\\"for not reporting environmental information.\\\" The aim of the investors was to push businesses such as Amazon to disclose information via the CDP, a not-for-profit platform which enables companies to divulge environmental performance data.A few months earlier, in April, thousands of Amazon employees signed an open letter to CEO Jeff Bezos and the firm is board of directors, imploring them to take action on climate change.In September, Amazon co-founded an initiative called The Climate Pledge, which asks signatories to become \\\"net zero carbon across their businesses\\\" by the year 2040.It has also launched what it calls a \\\"transparency website\\\" which it uses to report on what it describes as its \\\"sustainability commitments, initiatives, and performance.\\\" The site also has information on the firm is carbon footprint, which it reports as being 44.40 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for the 2018 fiscal year.Amazon is just one of many global technology firms looking to power operations using renewable sources of energy. In March 2019, for example, Microsoft signed a 15-year power purchase agreement for the energy produced by a 74-megawatt solar power facility in North Carolina, while in April 2018 Apple announced its global facilities were powered using \\\"100 percent clean energy.\\\"Making sure that its facilities are powered by clean energy is a multi-faceted process for Apple.In its Environmental Responsibility Report covering the 2018 fiscal year the California-headquartered firm said that, where feasible, it sourced renewable energy by building its own projects. In addition, it invests capital to become a part owner in wind and solar projects and signs \\\"long-term renewable energy contracts.\\\"\",\n          \"The ongoing trade war President Donald Trump has waged against world powers, including some of our closest allies, does not show signs of slowing down.Left in the fray: Companies, American workers and consumers.The list of companies affected, either by planning to close plants, laying off employees, tossing out plans for new jobs or raising prices continues to grow.On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced it was escalating the battle with China by moving forward with a 25 percent tariff on $16 billion in Chinese goods.

Amazon said the facility could power the equivalent of 46,000 U.K. homes and would be the U.K. is \\\"largest corporate wind power purchase agreement.\\\" Additionally, two solar projects in North Carolina and Virginia will amount to 215 MW of total capacity, with Amazon expecting them to produce 500,997 MWh per year. The projects announced Thursday are expected to start generating energy in 2021. They are not owned by the company, but it says its commitment to purchase their output enables the projects to be built.

In March 2019, for example, Microsoft signed a 15-year power purchase agreement for the energy produced by a 74-megawatt solar power facility in North Carolina, while in April 2018 Apple announced its global facilities were powered using \\\"100 percent clean energy.\\\"Making sure that its facilities are powered by clean energy is a multi-faceted process for Apple.In its Environmental Responsibility Report covering the 2018 fiscal year the California-headquartered firm said that, where feasible, it sourced renewable energy by building its own projects.

Amazon said the facility could power the equivalent of 46,000 U.K. homes and would be the U.K. is \\\"largest corporate wind power purchase agreement.\\\" Additionally, two solar projects in North Carolina and Virginia will amount to 215 MW of total capacity, with Amazon expecting them to produce 500,997 MWh per year.
